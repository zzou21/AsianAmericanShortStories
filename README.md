**AsteXT**

The AsteXT project builds a story classifier using Natural Language Processing to identify trends in Asian American short stories. By building a model that registers a story's genre, main themes, common word choices, and publication year, this model aims to identify a shift in literary trends from 20th-century Asian American short stories to those in the 21st century, especially those originally published online.

This project is created using BERT, SciKitLearn, and NLTK.

**Current updates**:
Finished writing the first preliminary classification fine-tuned BERT model that determines whether the inputted short story was published before or after 2014. This preliminary model is to test whether using BERT is a realistic approach to this project.
