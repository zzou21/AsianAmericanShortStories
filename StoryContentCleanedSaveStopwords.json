    "DonutMan": "when he woke me it wa still dark i would been curled into the passenger seat of the van while he stripped and waxed the tile of a jiffy lube `` beak '' he said `` let u get after it '' `` it '' wa money i knew because for the past few month we spent our unsupervised visitation working one of his business my father never had a steady paycheck his odd job rewarded only hustle i wa nine when i stayed with him he would sleep through the afternoon while i read for school or played gameboy then rush me through dinner to make it to a flooring job we showed up late after the business had closed i would help him unload the van sometimes sweep or mop but i wa too young for the thin hour of the night when i got tired i lay down in front seat the whir of car lulling me to sleep a they passed there were day i would wake up while we were on the go unaware of the movement but on night when the job ran long night like this one we went straight to the donut factory this wa before krispy kreme had their own store before they had a station in every giant and safeway up the coast and still garnered interest in their rarity guy like my father hand raw from disinfectant the sol of his new balance slick with wax showed up with the sun to stuff their vehicle with the green and white box hoping to resell them and pocket the markup it wa the saturday before thanksgiving and holiday made for easy sale but even so i knew we would have trouble unloading the amount he insisted on buying his aerostar van wa a windowless smoky black with the chrome stripped off while he loaded box in the back of it from floor mat to bare ceiling careful to keep everything separate from the mop bucket the floor buffer i watched the worker make donut in the back of the factory through the viewing window the circle of dough drift along in a river of oil starting soft white dropped straight from the dispenser and ending on the drying rack goldenbrown the sugar coming up in fume `` beak get your face off the glass '' he said my father called me `` beak '' because while we were both chinese i had not yet grown into my mom 's british nose we had not spent more than a weekend together since the divorce four year prior he took his billfold from his pocket peeled off a couple one and handed it the floor manager who knocked on the glass and held up two finger on the other side of the window the baker wore plastic apron and latex glove hairnet and safety goggles they took two donut straight off the conveyer belt slid them in a wax paper sleeve and brought them out to u the heat of the pastry in my hand created a hunger i had not known and i swallowed the donut in three bite it wa barely solid so sweet it made my teeth ache and i wanted another immediately `` when wa the last time your mom fed you something this good for breakfast '' i wa too busy licking the glaze off the back of my teeth to think about my usual breakfast the off brand cheerio dense a cardboard wet with rice milk both donated from the church my mother dragged me to depending how far we were from her last paycheck the meal became le complex at first pasta homemade sauce sauteed vegetable salted chicken and a week later plain rice canned tuna soy sauce for flavor those meal she would stir her food between bite a if it were hiding beneath it something worth savoring i often tried to choose relative hunger instead of clearing my plate we would push it back and forth between u on the table until she would slam a fist down saying `` eat dammit i do not work this hard for you to spit in my face '' there wa something raw in her tone when the dish stopped rattling her voice cooled `` i am sorry baby please '' our route took u from the factory back toward his basement studio we used to hit the strip of business park and car lot congesting the main road reaching out from 495 and the district rockville gaithersburg college park laurel any hospitality service that needed giveaway or a staff that might want breakfast the spot my father sold to often the receptionist would declare 'donut man '' a we came through the door box stacked on my forearm when we were entered somewhere new he said it himself at a car dealership he leaned against the counter speaking to a woman on the other side the tag heuer watch hanging from his wrist wa older than me one time my mother joked that it would been in and out of pawnshop a often a my father had been in and out of jail the mention of prison took the humor from her face `` mind your manner jason '' he said `` tell miss cindy hello '' a a kid i would been mild in temperament bad at making eye contact prone to long passage of silence but we were a fatherson sale team and part of that act required me to smile when addressed i am not sure when my big gummed grin became genuine warmed by the attention i said hi a my father opened the box on the top of the stack miss cindy looked at the variety dozen then me saying `` well i do not know which is sweeter '' we set the donut on the counter folded bill returned to the van to restock my father only really taught me two thing in life the first wa how to take money off people who had it to spend we were on the beltway and he decided we could sell more if we split up awake all night cleaning floor he wa beginning to fade a the day wore on he would not admit it but his eye were ringed red and we would barely made a dent in the product i wa worried that no one would want to buy from just me no jewelry no swagger or familiarity but he assured me saying `` all you got to do is treat them like you love them bat your eye a little if they do not want to buy hey no sweat see you next time thanks anyway you can not make anyone do anything '' the next stop in tacoma park he gave me enough cash to make change then put me out on my own we priced a dozen glazed at ten the assorted box of jelly and chocolate and bavarian cream for thirteen one of each for twenty i kept repeating this pitch in my head a i went into the store my first few attempt a laundry mat a radioshack the post office were met with polite rejection i wa too courteous entering silently and waiting in line the mail clerk behind the glass barricade looked at the box then over my head and toward the door before saying no with a smile i crossed the street my arm shaking a bit under the weight of the box there wa a bank on the corner and a i approached the wide double door a woman held one open for me saying `` are not you precious '' part of me worried i wa moving too slowly that i would have kept my father waiting and his impatience would turn to anger or disappointment part of me worried i would come back without making a sale i walked past the velvet rope and the stanchion that formed a queue to the teller toward a man sitting at the desk in the middle of the lobby i said `` krispy kreme '' when i wa within ear shot he said `` well what have you got here '' and i gave him the pitch the pricing the bank manager wa older his hair thin at the temple silver rose patterned across his tie he told me they had a meeting coming up in an hour and would not it be nice to provide some refreshment for the broker and rep that morning he bought everything i wa carrying and i skipped back to the van waving the cash like a trophy my father had just closed the sliding door when he saw me he snatched the money from my hand a bit of spit coming off his lip a he asked me if i wa stupid he said `` you know the best way to lose something beak let someone know you have it to lose '' in the passenger seat i shrunk into the cushion resting my head against the doorframe he closed the door and sat joining the money i would earned with the roll in his pocket before we left the parking lot he took his bifocals off and polished the dust from the lens he said `` you need to know how to be careful '' always count the money by the door the trick is to keep small bill on the outside and stow it in your front pocket where it is hard to get to the skin on his knuckle looked like worn leather sliding into his jean his old graduation ring studding his pinky to this day i have never misplaced a bill each stop we split up halfway around the beltway i came back from my round to find him napping with the holiday around the corner and a bit of encouragement people were looking for excuse to indulge the ease of the sale only fueled this new confidence each time i came back to the van emptyhanded i wa fired up eventually my mom would lock him up again for falling too far behind on the child support but just then i rode shotgun a stomach made for sugar and a newfound love of counting cash stop after stop while he napped i hefted the donut into my arm brought the box into doctor 's office and furniture store real estate headquarters and used car lot pulling back the glass and saying `` krispy kreme '' i woke him when we needed to move and halfway around the beltway i sold the last dozen glazed to a dentist off route 1 the wad in my pocket wa so thick my pant fit tighter i knuckled him in the bicep and he rubbed his eye pushed his bifocals up the bridge of his nose he said `` where to '' `` home '' `` we have got work to do beak '' he said the cough in his waking throat sounded thick with mucous `` where to '' `` home '' i said `` they are all gone '' maybe it wa exhaustion but the wrinkled brow the pinched confusion of his expression made me feel like i wa lying to him he turned in the seat to the belly of the van empty now except for the cleaning supply the comforter that covered them when he smiled i could see the gold crown glowing like ember in the back of his mouth he dropped the van into gear and put u on the road on good day we would get wing and rib tip from a chinese carryout around the corner from his basement studio we would each eat half of one dish then trade side by side in the front of the van we ate until our fork scraped the bottom of the styrofoam tray until we unbuttoned our jean to get comfortable `` your mother and i used to live above a spot like this in wheaton the kitchen wa below our bedroom just the smell of chicken would turn her stomach but you know i wa always craving it '' he said `` i bet she still doe not let you eat it '' `` she say eating out is a waste of money '' cartilage from the pork cracked between his teeth and he grunted the bone into a napkin my arm my foot ached from the hustle in the driveway we instinctively opened the sliding door on the van to carry in what we could not get rid of the donut we would eat for dinner but i would sold u out in my pocket wa the proof i showed it too him the roll of bill suspended between u bulging out my fist and i felt alive `` hey donut man '' he said standing over me inspecting the feature of my face i could see my reflection in his glass distorted by the curve of the lens we were so much the same except for those small and important difference that are lost when the eye is not focused how i do not fully recognize myself now when it is four in the morning and i am washing my face in the sink after a shift the tip in my jean still damp from the beerslick bar how tired and worn thinner by liquor i look out the window and can not tell if the sun is coming soon or just gone with his finger he tapped me on the nose saying `` hand it over ''",
    "TheBridalSet": "i had forgotten that it wa a city of plan people made them penciled them into calendar popped their collar and showed up with honesty on their face in those day i had none what i had were some buttondowns in a carryon a scraped and stinging elbow from an escalator incident at the airport an empty booze cabinet with a single can of tonic water waiting for me at my hotel it wa bombay in may glass went milky when door opened when door closed i waited for manish by the door of the polo bar where a line for entry wa beginning to form despite the early hour a i waited the rain beat the awning over my head in sheet sounded like an animal being lashed i wa visiting india because i could tell from my wife 's face when she walked into a room that she had hoped i wa not there you can only see a woman 's face turn so swiftly with such surety that the smile ought to disappear so many time before you believe it might be time to change something about yourself or in my case to take a flight so i wa glad to be there my collar encircled with damp the air heavy with it familiar salt and whiff of petrol my presence unremarked by the passing body who hurried towards and past me into the bar one of these body burly and short in a black tshirt that strained to make the distance across his chest and biceps approached me the way you approach air conditioning skin warm arm splayed smile rippling in the day before we became husband and father before our real life happened manish wa a stud a stallion a st mary 's head boy and eventually a rolexwearing paper magnate he wa one of those mythological figure who received proposal through the ringing telephone family from lucknow and hyderabad who saw him shimmering at soandso is wedding family hoping they needed to arrange just one coffee between him and their newly graduated daughter to gain a soninlaw the rest of u had to do it the hard way you would show up freshly shaved to whatever second cousin 's friend 's house sit in a corner with the girl 's father and brother hoping the girl in question spared you a single glance just one and if she did then the afternoon wa spent in a spell of drowsy relief relief that manish would never need to know for when he wa twentyfour he had fallen in love with a londonborn delhi girl on a work trip brought her home to bombay and watched pridefully a she went off on marxist sermon in the corner of party but to their story too there wa a crisp turning of the lock that marked the end after three decade their marriage wa over manish wa on his own now looking for work the rumor of his rough patch a we would come to call these phase of our life were floated to me through a chain of our oldest friend the year before returning home to india from a trip abroad manish had walked into his living room full of company executive -- his uncle and brother his father his petite wife at the head he wa advised to accept his share of asset and bow out of the business they deemed him unfit to stand at the helm based on his penchant for luxury item they pointed at his shoe his watch his goldplated cufflink which he had recently gotten engraved with his initial m m ticking beneath this meeting and it excuse for manish 's expulsion wa a nastier truer thread of news circulated on group chat that did not include him they claimed that his wife the marxist had fallen in love with manish 's father together they had plotted to remove manish from their life about this people speculated changed their story agreed and disagreed but the verdict of the whole saga floated above their chatter like a big gray cloud that no one wanted to see the fact wa that parent and child alike could do unspeakable thing we walked through the polo bar slowly like two men in trouble it wa a time in my life when i believed that everyone wa suspicious of me i felt they could see through to my brain that endless list of knot i needed to untie in this lifetime the bastard i needed to forgive and the bigger bastard i needed to forgive me my unending roster of debt uncollected and owed would they ever stop accruing i thought then that life wa just that a trip to the bank you racked up credit accidentally used it all and found yourself sitting across from a teller in malabar hill sliding a wad of rupee bill under the table asking for access to your dead mother 's bank locker in order to liquidate her old wedding jewelry a we walked to our table i searched manish 's profile for a glint of these story for a clue of our shared aloneness but he had his teeth whitened recently and that wa all i could see two row of piano key bright a mercury i had been to the polo bar a a kid snuck a sip of my father 's macallan on the rock and wa smacked across the face for doing so back then the bar wa a daytime visit a postnewspaper and tea meeting point for the family of malabar hill who had been invited to join the club a member you were either invited referred or given membership in the will of an aloof and longdead parent or grandparent it wa a big deal back then to receive one of those handwritten invitation to interview at the hill club if you made it through it meant you were a welltalkedabout family a family with one mama and one papa with no divorce or suicide rotting leaf on the family tree what you got for your good reputation and sturdy financial sense wa access to a tennis court the polo bar and a pale blue lap pool that no one used because most apartment building on the hill had pool anyway a group of people who seemed to know manish floated over to say hello a we took our seat i did not recognize any of them and did not feel the need to make new friend i wa slightly disturbed by how drastically the bar had changed i looked up from the anonymous powdered face of manish 's friend and saw what used to be she willwhite wall rattan furniture bamboo ceiling fan that rotated slowly and uselessly overhead a number of indoor plant bright and unfurling host to small swarm of insect that hovered permanently above their color no television only an omnipresent radio that announced the highlight of whatever cricket match wa happening that week sunlight would splash on the table like paint the day 's dust dipping and swirling around u my little sister her hair strung up in two asymmetrical ponytail beaming demonically at me for anticipation of some prank she would pulled that i wa not aware of just yet salt inside my glass of coke etcetera now the bar wa polished and dark a halfway imitation of an american dive it wa remodeled in the early 2000s with marbled wood and central air conditioning a verbal history provided by the mustached manager who trotted over at some point with a big slap on manish 's shoulder the air wa dry and cool and our waiter brought over large jug of iced waterit wa a farewell to the delicious dampness that made place like this buzz though i thought i felt a raindrop land on my skull when i looked up i saw that the fan had remained they were frozen above u those gorgeous golden slat dirt wa crusted over the blade like ash `` politician -- he is fit to be a politician '' manish wa saying to one of his crony with a big smile his finger ringed with a thick gold band pointed at the man in question around u people crowded at table like insect to light standing sitting one leg on a barstool one off arranging garment checking pocket checking purse i saw a man a few table over bring a hand to the dark space under the table and pull at his crotch i felt the relief too thing falling back into place i gave a strong imitation of someone who felt comfortable laughing with all my teeth ha ha ha people were dressed in rich color burgundy and beige hair bouncy bright with shine or cropped close to the scalp glistening with stiffness the seam of their blouse seemed so perfectly snug that it wa clear they had been tailored some of the woman even looked at me `` hey darling '' they seemed to say i felt myself harden at just the implication i wa trying to live in the moment more if i wa not thinking about money i wa usually thinking about when i would enjoy my next drink the thirst wa tidal deafening it flapped wildly in my ear gave everything a grayish tint that i worried would become permanent blackandwhite vision forever like a dog 's i allowed myself one slow breath to focus on what wa around me the promise of a drink close enough to suspend worry the thought made me suddenly cheerful under my own spell i heard the barroom chatter rise like it wa controlled by a volume knob once manish 's various greeter left he looked at me with the high bite of someone who ha been made to look good in public out of goodwill and impatience i ordered u a round of vodka on ice sliding my card out of it place slowly carefully praying manish would object by presenting his own but of course he did not he kept his gaze firmly in the opposite direction until i asked that the tab stay open i wa not sure if the charge would go through `` i always say '' said manish continuing the thread of some conversation that could have been unfolding for some time `` the last safe place for crook is india all of you in america are living on borrowed time '' i did not respond i had played out the india versus america debate so many time in my mind that i had prevented myself from ever reaching an opinion on the topic they were both dead end that is place in which you could die if you wanted to the only difference wa that the crook of one place felt familiar in a way that the other would not no matter how many election i voted in or costco membership i renewed i rubbed my palm against my face thoughtfully to avoid having to say anything `` why did you come then '' manish asked `` how is natasha '' from somewhere in his pocket he found a toothpick and took it to his teeth where he winced and continued to hit a particularly sore region of gum there wa something about it all that endeared him to me my old friend shading his mouth out of propriety i felt his bulk his comfort his direct question a a warmth particular to that side of the world in bombay every friendship wa scintillated by exchange of information about other people i did not want to be the wind that blew my own bad news to another man 's ringing telephone `` vacation brother '' i said `` look at this liar '' his flat palm clapped suddenly at my cheek `` you do not have to do all this drama buddy '' he said `` everyone ha heard '' i laughed by accident i had been drinking since ten that morning `` now listen '' he said `` listening '' `` are you listening '' i nodded he leaned in close a if to say something religious `` move back '' he said his palm slapping the table for emphasis `` all your friend are here you can live in your parent ' old flat no i wa sorry about your mom 's passing man but i am sure the old houseboy will even come back to work for you what wa his name chintu good fellow loyal tell me is it true the apartment is just sitting empty because if you do not intend to sell it off i will happily look into it for you `` are you listening '' he asked again `` listening '' i said natasha appeared once more in my vision that neat trick of marriage and i looked instinctively at my thigh knowing how she would commit some violence to my leg under the table if she were here she never liked manish `` listen now divorce rate are going up here too -- every tom dick and harry is getting divorced '' he said `` lot of single woman '' `` we are not getting divorced '' i said `` buddy i heard that she did not even let you come back for your mother 's funeral is that true you missed your own mother 's funeral because of her '' he wa speaking very loudly and i wa struck with that old gift of defense i knew so well a a young man i explained that my oldest daughter had been going through a hard time at school natasha had been on the night shift for three month there were thing i needed to take care of at home i could not have left `` you are not listening '' he said `` your chain have been loosened you are free i tell you we were lunatic to get married so young '' i stood up slowly gesturing to my desire for another drink the glass at the polo bar were so small it wa a complaint i had heard from my father 's mouth a a child he wa right wa he always right another i asked manish with my eye i did not mention that i had thought up a plan to deal with my unobliging card i would keep the tab open let the card hit the limit then call the bank in the morning to report the entire transaction a fraud my wallet wa stolen i would say manish gazed into his crystal affectionately `` you know what '' he shouted a i wa halfway to the bar `` why not '' elbow on the counter i wa caught by the arabesque of liquor bottle that made up the far wall of the bar they reflected the soft overhead light shade of toffee and chartreuse twinkling like they were in conversation with one another to my left and right people were talking i held the noise of their moving voice a a weight in my ear yes i wa suspended somewhere in the blackorange light a man in limbo a man with no country i heard myself order our drink with the transcontinental twang i usually saved for call center and air hostess i wa a man of here living there a man of there visiting here i wanted everyone to know it i wa a stranger a guest an apparition a man on parole it wa my first time back in ten year and even then i knew that the polo bar would not see my face again for another twenty i imagined that i would go back to my wife with a fresh beam of light in my eye i would swing her leg over my hip in truth we had talked about divorce some month before my trip she had poured my last bottle of stoli down the kitchen sink and i delirious childishly hopeful about our situation spat in her face it wa my fiftythird birthday and we were back from a party at the neighbor 's she had worn a velvet dress with red stitching that went to her calf all evening she wa a kind of beautiful dragonfly passing from group to group with the flutter of one who is liked by people and know it swinging out the cake clapping with her long almond fingernail in our own home hour later she wa swinging a knife screaming into the belly of our hallway that she wanted to stab me we talked to each other that way sometimes i did not mind she came to bed later complaining about the banana they were ripening too fast in the heat the first sunny day of spring a hatch of small fly were disguising themselves in the spotted peel you could not see them until you touched the banana and then they would fly up in a panic it wa disgusting she said she had to throw them all out we could just live without i felt the tragedy of this exchange a if she were talking about a child of ours from the bar i watched the door swing open for a woman in black she moved like a bride watchful her destination clear to herself and those who looked up to watch her she wore a sleek satin top that fell into fold at her chest hiding any cleavage but revealing a set of collarbone strong a branch there wa some hubbub further down the bar where a bearded man had spilled a red drink across his beige trouser he angrily patted at his crotch with a napkin emptying his embarrassment on the bartender who observed from the other side of the counter apologetically when i looked for the woman again her jewelstudded hand with it darkly painted fingernail appeared at the back of manish 's neck where it pinched the skin lightly i started to walk over to the table when it occurred to me that it wa bad manner not to bring her a drink i set manish 's glass down in front of her knowing he would understand her finger wrapped around the crystal easily for this i could tell that she wa a woman who knew bad luck she sipped without making a face manish and i looked around the room while she drank hiding our wonder a i sipped my own drink i had a perfect understanding of their romance he loved her more than she loved him this woman who wa not his wife i felt a palpable and fast camaraderie with the pair we were three fool who had failed at marriage `` i would like to play a card game '' i heard myself tell them a skewered olive bursting bitterly on my tongue i do not know where my memory go from there i see now manish 's greenish jowl moving to call my ear to his mouth instructing me to stick out my tongue with that low whisper he reserved even in our school day for shenanigan there wa a blank sensation on my tongue left there by the tap of his finger but he could not have given me the tab in the open like that it would have happened in a bathroom stall or some dark alley still i see u both laughing gripping each other 's arm in anticipation of the fun we were about to get into those large fan still above u in the high crescent of my eyeline i see the woman in black shaking her head disapprovingly but with that familiar sly smile of amusement that i had seen before on my wife 's face when our daughter pushed each other around then we were all in a rickshaw headed past marine drive past the flora fountain past a woman wrapped in red fabric sweeping rubbish off her stoop with a broom she looked calmly at our passing vehicle before adjusting her sari and continuing to sweep the little car ricketed a though we were traveling over cobblestone it might even have been the case some old stone from the nineteenth century i did not recall looking down to check but it wa not difficult to picture the jackal or even to hear them chirping from a time when much of the city wa still an overgrown jungle i pictured phantom bird wild thing flower opening their sugary petal and then marigold garland which were real drooping from the rain around framed picture of dead relative picture of goddess nailed into arbitrary wall and left for a morning visit we approached a graying construction with gothic arch and a red central dome something that looked a though it had been clipped and pasted out of a fading european postcard it stone exterior stolid and bourgeois the road dipped surreptitiously into a back alley and without warning we were underground i got a whiff of patchouli and amber which escaped from the cold wind of the oak door a it opened and closed for other guest behind the door wa a blank room with a crystal chandelier and intricate paneling empty aside from a wood desk with a clipboard and a pen hearing our noise two security guard in what seemed to be bulletproof vest stepped in front of u both of them chewing what i assumed to be paan from the reddish stain on the outer wall roughly they asked manish what he wa looking for i could hear the steady vibration of western music coming from further inside manish pulled out a card from his wallet to show his membership which satisfied the two guard they vetted u by patting our back stopping at manish 's girlfriend sonali `` sir this is a gentleman 's club '' said one of the guard manish made a show of digging inside his pocket for something and tucked a few note into the man 's vest `` they make you carry weapon and all '' manish joked to smooth over his bribe `` this is not an airport bhai no terrorist coming here '' by a single touch of his chest the guard could tell how much money manish had given him he shot a neutral look at the other guard whose expression seemed to encourage more haggling following a quick dart of whisper between themselves in a dialect i could not identify they moved aside to let sonali pas manish led u through a dim hallway where all the light wa kept out by a thick burgundy curtain in the inner room cheap purple light twinkled where the ceiling met the wall there were two makeshift stage with pole and plush chair around the periphery a tall woman came to greet u her palm joined together in a casual namaste it wa only when i heard the gruff bubble of manish 's laughter that i realized the woman wa nearly naked from the waist down she wore a traditional sari with a thighhigh opening from where a bronzed leg would protrude each time she took a step forward to cover her breast she wore a jeweled bra her skin appeared lacquered and it glowed an electric blue under the light `` some goddess '' sonali whispered to me the woman led manish to a chair in the room in front of a pole that she prepared to use by undressing from the waist down underneath her sari she wore a gold thong the string of which she checked for tightness there were two other men inside a fatherson duo once we were seated they raised their glass to u and manish called out to them with his usual masculine warmth `` kesai ho bhai '' the father nodded his head to indicate that he wa doing well and invited over a member of the waitstaff relieved i thought i heard him order u a round his son looked nauseous either at our presence or his own he sported a fresh pubescent mustache and a yankee tshirt both of which he fussed with incessantly sweating bottle of kingfisher appeared beside each of u looking up i saw a young woman in a bindi and glass holding an empty tray she wa dressed in a white shirt and a black vest though i remember thinking she looked young enough to wear a school uniform i had the urge to ask how she got caught up in this world from what i knew of bombay you could ask people thing like that and they would tell you they would inch out torn photograph from the fold of their clothing a an explanation usually a child or a sick mother in some faroff village i wanted to ask but i wa beginning to feel exhausted from our journey for a moment i could not remember if i had left my car at the polo bar and if i had a i suspected forgotten where i parked i needed to find it at some point we thanked the man across the room for our drink he raised one palm in our direction a a parting greeting it occurred to me then that he wanted u to continue to exist in the room in our disjointed world the drink were a promise of that -- his own privacy time began to disappear replaced by wave of wanting and unwanting want a pressure at my lip my wife 's sleeping body in it curled shape beside me in my mind i began a conversation with her i told her that i knew what my problem wa that i had been too happy a a child and had lived my entire adulthood trying to recapture that rapture and wa i sorry for what i did she would ask yes i wa sorry a the finale of our argument she would often assert that i did not consider our family my real family `` you think your real life is still in india '' she would say i knew that she did not speak the truth to help me see myself clearly she told the truth to hurt me to humiliate me in front of our child this wa the dance of our marriage and so i would put out a hand for the waltz `` this is not a home '' i said to her during one of these fight `` this is temporary for all of u '' the fizz of beer rose in my mouth in it i tasted the black tongue of our argument on the other makeshift stage where the boy and his father were sitting a shining lilac woman crawled around the floor at our stage the gold woman 's eye became a clothesline connecting to manish i figured she could tell he wa the only one among u with money i thought about the exchange rate if manish wa putting exactly seventyfour rupee between the string and her skin `` i heard you are getting bored '' sonali said to me i motioned for her to repeat herself into my ear the speaker vibration overpowered the melody of whatever song wa playing `` i heard you are getting divorced '' i told her that i wa still married that i intended to stay that way `` me too '' she smiled her breath gingery and bright she turned the diamond around from the inside of her palm and presented her left hand to me it wa a modest ring an oldfashioned band the setting had been popular in the ninety thick gold with a smattering of small diamond my father had specialized in it back when his shop wa still open the bridal set the bestseller the winner the one that paid the bill when my father sold his first we celebrated with a dutyfree bottle of moet chandon i wa not much of a joker never the funny guy but i instinctively jabbed manish in the arm `` congratulation yaar '' i said `` you could not buy her a better ring this design is thirty year old '' manish dismissed my comment with a sharp shake of his head he wa focused on some trick the woman in gold wa performing with a lollipop sonali put a hand on my chin for some reason i felt that i wa the one who wa undressed `` not him '' she said `` i am married to rohit shetty '' `` the real estate guy '' she nodded `` is not he in jail '' she looked down at her hand her ring shining like a berry i knew jail i wanted to say when you are at the bottom you come to know all the dark place that you thought were only for other people in fact they are for everyone they welcome you you are in them before you know it but it wa not the time to talk about myself i felt manish 's eye on u and when i turned to face him he took one of sonali 's cheek between his thumb and index finger he kissed her with a splotch on the mouth i pretended to be engrossed by the woman on the pole knowing i would not get aroused with a teenage boy in my eyeline i watched his hand flutter to the lobe of his ear his gaze zip between his crotch and his father parsing out the correct behavior for a situation like this i thought then that maybe we did not like ourselves very much i tried to catch the boy 's eye so we could share something some wave of discomfort a shrug and that wa when manish stood up and walked to the front of the stage with a curled finger he called the woman from her high place on the pole she faced away from manish and bent down so that she wa on her hand and knee he raised his hand to touch her but a man 's voice erupted from the back room `` no touching '' it wa the security guard from earlier he approached the stage with a baton in hand `` no touching '' sonali and i watched a manish grabbed the woman with his right hand she let out a shriek and it felt like a glass prism had shattered somewhere in the room the guard rushed over to manish and held his two limb apart a he struggled against them they waited for the woman in gold to have her revenge she caught manish by the collar and channeled her twentysomething year into a gorgeous crystalline glob of spit they hit him once to stop him from struggling and i with my misplaced righteousness stood up to help my friend for several minute they were on both of u and we ended up on the ground fighting audibly cursing each other for our stupidity once the commotion flatlined a high whistle began to sound in my ear or maybe it did not happen like that maybe it wa something else that bruised my rib but i remembered the woman 's voice calling the guard by his first name for help ashwin ashwinder one of those godly name manish 's lower lip had swollen into a fig and sonali kept her gaze fixed outside the window of our cab the shifting navy screen of nighttime copper and crystal light manish asked her to take a look at his mouth he held it to her eye a chubby finger pointing at the damage `` you act like a donkey you are going to get treated like one '' she said there wa a lull sound of traffic a series of gated apartment building i felt the faint pulsing of blood in my ear though i wa too afraid to touch it in case i wa left with a profile of mangled flesh `` now we do what he want to do '' manish said it wa an instruction to the cab driver who turned around and looked at me i wa humming an old bollywood love song that my mother would often sing after dinner when she took a knife to the spotted skin of a pear for our dessert i aimed my humming at sonali who knew the tune immediately o heart take me to the alley the stream of love i have gotten lost looking at the moon waiting for her to come back we sang together in the backseat of the cab and a silver thrill flashed and disappeared between u i heard myself guiding the driver about where to go with manish 's interjection when we arrived twin gate swung open to let u in a security guard in a blue uniform delight across his face walked u into the marble foyer past a placard the size of a billboard listing last name and apartment number we were headed to 5a and everyone seemed to know though no one had to say it the elderly elevator attendant called me by my name `` well '' he said to sonali in hindi `` they are men now i have been here since they were this small '' his flat palm shot down to his waist for a visual representation we all breathed loudly the lobe of our ear red the apartment door wa open or at least i did not remember hearing a click at the keyhole i could not tell you how many people were present how many of them rushed to the door to greet u making a commotion of our chest and cheek with their hand i could not tell you if it wa real but i remember that i wa presented with a toffeecolored dachshund who yapped into my hair manish switched on light that glowed from the two baby chandelier illuminating a room heavy with the thick hot haze of men drinking i saw that there were two table set up one for food and one for a game of card i pulled out a chair at the first table settling the dog in my lap and found myself face to face with an uninspiring cucumber salad beside me there seemed to be an old woman counting cash she looked up with indifference and i thought it wa strange how closely she resembled my mother she wa dressed in a victorian nightgown her long gray hair in a thin braid that hung by her waist i knew the texture of her at once the straw hair the pilly cloth the perfect white crescent of her fingernail i wanted to hear her voice i asked her what wa in the salad `` arre chintu '' she yelled into the sky `` inside salad what is '' an irritated young man scurried from the kitchen his hand wet from the stillrunning tap in english he began reciting the ingredient counting them off on his finger `` cucumber mint pear apple honey watermelon '' `` it is a fruit salad '' the woman clarified matteroffactly `` please eat all day you have not eaten '' i watched her finger swipe bill after bill the freckle of old age dusted across her arm surely it wa my mother dead now for over a year i nodded at her to seem calm and wondered how long i could continue to sit there without somebody asking me to introduce myself from inside the kitchen manish brought me a glass of something pink a sweet foam nearly running off the brim `` it is really hitting me now '' he said i remembered then that we had taken something before we left the polo bar it consequence were concentrated in my eyeball across the room chair scraped the floor pink a the poker table wa set up the salad wa plump squealing thing i could not understand i remembered feeling a deep sadness that everything in the world wa not painted green the best color i hungered for green the gift of sunlight flecked on leaf the pale chartreuse of american money people kept patting me on the back saying that it wa good to see me `` good to see you tiger '' they said some of them had long naughty anecdote from when we were in school together me the backbencher bribing lecture proctor to count me a present when i wa anything but what wa i even doing no one knew i would just disappear they said it wa a miracle i ever graduated i asked whose house we were in but even at this they laughed i thought the dachshund laughed at me too but she had only raised her small skull to observe the noise before letting it settle again on her front paw i felt unwelcome annoyed that everyone behaved a if they knew something i did not i looked at the old woman with a blank face like i wa in on the joke and she smiled back at me warmly `` eat something '' she urged again she pushed a plate towards me thumped a helping of salad on it side it wa usually impossible to negotiate with woman like her -- benevolent party ghost who forcefed guest until they begged for peace there wa one of them in every old apartment i complimented the food after my first bite and removed myself from her reach on the far end of the room sonali wa running a hand over the woodwork on one of the cabinet i had watched a youtube documentary about her husband 's arrest the court were auctioning off their various property the dubai villa the alibaug farmhouse the bandra bungalow she saw me see her and a thought we shared told me that she wa remembering the house she once lived in i imagined it to be eclectic but classic like her something with many unsuspecting antique mixed with modern piece good art chestnut floor i could tell from the envy with which she eyed those old cabinet that the sadness she carried wa new i took the dog to her a a silent offering but she recoiled at the sight of it tongue afraid she wa never one for small creature she explained ordering me to take it away standing next to her i became aware that i wa newly damp between my leg my first thought wa menstrual blood but then i remembered that that could not be i took the dog with me to the closest bathroom a dark highceilinged space with a black toilet for several moment a i undid the button of my jean i considered the possibility that my body wa changing that i wa being sucked into a deep emerald hell i held onto the wall frightened certain that i would not be strong enough to withstand any sort of karmic wind the oculus in the ceiling appeared to open briefly and i felt tremendous shame standing there a the universe opened up before me in my underwear i shook myself dry and took the dachshund to my breast the picture on the wall were in shade of sepia and gray posed photograph of a young woman her bouffant stiff a a lampshade holding a bundle of cloth to her neck a baby in another photo a man with a furrowed brow carried the child older then on his shoulder i wa looking at the picture when sonali came in `` princess '' she said to the dog refusing to hold her again i showed her what i saw expecting her to provide me with some history her hand wa on my back she asked if i knew that the lady 's husband died in a terrible accident some year before he had drowned `` drowned '' i asked `` he wa a drunk '' sonali said `` he tried to go swimming '' she leaned against the sink produced a cigarette from somewhere in her pant and brought a flame to her face with the nonchalance of an old habit a velvety puff of smoke surrounded u i let the dachshund out wanting to fill the silence i asked sonali to tell me something surprising she said there wa another man in the picture a man other than manish other than her husband he lived in london i thought wow it wa my turn and i shared that i had kissed a man once during a dry phase of much rejection from both employer and woman i wa twentyone newly anointed with a bachelor 's degree in management science though i wa not ready to manage anything yet and did i enjoy it she asked i confessed that i did though i did not know it myself for some time unprompted sonali began to talk about her husband she said it wa an open relationship now that she wa not doing anything wrong `` rohit always had his whore '' she said i wanted her to say more but i knew that anything she said would depress me talking about other couple wa always a dangerous game either they made you think you could have done better for yourself found someone a good for you a they were for each other or that you could have been better for your wife which wa always true but she still loved him she admitted she believed he wa innocent `` i do not think he is '' i said `` he wa convicted '' then she stopped talking we listened together to the insect outside who said thing we could not understand i could hear them in color brilliant pink and orange chirping chatting out in the wind i knew i wa hallucinating only when i began to hear a sitar track the melody of the song we were singing earlier sonali looked at me like she understood what wa happening like she heard it too `` relax '' she said there wa her hand again making a generous circle on my back i wanted to put my arm around her this firestarting woman i let her kiss me let her guide my hand to her thin silky underthings then down down where her leg were parted slightly in anticipation kissing her wa extraordinarily loud like moving furniture i had the instinct to swallow her whole i looked into the great glistening mound of her the reddened mouth the spidery lash the hint of an adam 's apple the growing redness of her inner thigh where my belt had hit up against some thin but strong bone i wa grateful i had not touched a woman other than my wife in twentyseven year she moaned so sweetly in my ear that i heard it a a chord i had another drink i felt i had some business to complete at the pool i knew where the pool would be from the way the body in the apartment craned their white neck out and down from the balcony i took the stair to the ground floor expected and received a whiff of dettol past the changing room i can not explain how i knew it would be there that black rectangle of stillwater shining under the moonlight like a sheet of metal i took off a shoe and threw it in to make sure it wa all real it wa the splash untied some taut ribbon deep in my abdomen and before i could think i had taken one step and then another laughing at myself the water wa warm tenderly it pulled me in set alight a coolness in my scalp in the center of the glowing orange square of the fifth floor i watched sonali 's body waver with the dachshund in her arm i knew that she recognized me from her great height and i wanted to return the comfort i waved to her an invitation there wa the sound of thunder from somewhere far away would it rain at first i felt fear for the weather for the gossip for the state of my marriage but beneath it growing i sensed the spread of a stony new calm i had an ancient impulse that knew this building knew this water i knew i had seen it all before a a child i had jumped off the diving board i had touched the bottom tile i swam out to the middle of the pool and dove under the string of an old memory came to me but i could not catch it in the deep the water wa colder it separated me from myself dulled the crescent of my fingertip i imagined that i wa all gone one with the black there wa no skin no cloth that made me different from this the dark i thought i saw a glint of something silver float close to my face and flicker away it looked like the long gray hair of an old woman i put my hand out for her to come again but she did not above water the thunder sounded again it belted gently muffled like word from another language the salt of hot tear ringed my eye not even our memory came back when we wanted them to i felt a rising froth of longing for my mother and then hand pulling me up quick by the collar",

    "TwoSecondsOfInspiration": "for a long a he could remember jalil had always been an aghazade `` it is a term of respect '' his father used to say `` it mean you are destined to bring about great change '' jalil 's father wa the one and only alireza modaressi one of the twelve member of the guardian council and the friday prayer leader in qom iran 's holiest city when jalil wa five year old he would gone downstairs one morning to grab breakfast and he would seen his father sitting at the kitchen table dressed in full religious garb turban and cloak sipping tea with ayatollah khomeini the supreme leader whom he would seen on tv every day of his life after that day jalil had realized the true power of his father growing up jalil wa never allowed to leave their mansion without permission if he wanted to go to the park and play their servant would have to call ahead and jalil would always show up to a deserted park that wa closed to the public just so he could play football with other little aghazades the son of other powerful family a security officer watched them nearby jalil wa homeschooled and forced to study the quran day and night his teacher another young aghazade taught him every subject from math and science to religious study but jalil 's favorite subject wa art he loved the work of bahman mohasses the `` persian picasso '' who painted ghastly minotaur and grotesque creature that haunted jalil 's dream `` why would he paint those thing '' he asked his father once `` because artist are heretic '' his father replied `` they will be damned in hell on judgement day '' religious cleric abhorred art and viewed it a the devil 's distraction but their hatred only intensified jalil 's fascination when he wa 13 he told their servant to buy some canvass and began painting secretly at night drawing bowl of fruit with vivid color that filled him with joy after a year or so his painting took a mohassesian turn and became absurdly grim threeheaded demon shrieking at the sky men with tortured face plunging into a lake of fire once he even drew a little boy standing on a chair beneath the word allah looping the first letter around his neck like a noose jalil wa shocked by the anguish that lurked in the depth of his mind when he wa 25 he graduated from seminary school and packed his bag to leave for america his father wanted him to study international relation at georgetown and he did not know when he would be back so he stuffed his painting in a box and tucked them away in the back of his closet where nobody would find them at georgetown he went to class in full religious garb to represent the islamic republic when other student found out who he wa they were either cordial towards him out of respect for his culture or they avoided him entirely one guy named david wa particularly obnoxious david would show up to class with slickedback hair and designer buttonups and he would take frequent bathroom break to powder his nose and come back twitching and sniffling jumping out of his seat to engage in political discussion `` all i am saying is you people are fucked '' david told jalil one day after class `` you iranian have the audacity to attack an american tanker in the strait of hormuz what the hell were you thinking '' `` it wa not u we did not do it '' `` well then who did '' `` i do not know '' `` oh c'mon this is what you guy do every time deny deny deny '' `` i am just being honest with you '' `` oh are you '' david chuckled derisively `` you should be careful about what come out of your mouth when you talk to me do you know who my family is '' `` no '' jalil said `` let me put it this way my father wa in the situation room last night with the president and his staff they are going to send b52 bomber to your country and blow you to smithereens '' jalil wa concerned powerful american like david 's father were nationalist hawk and war with iran wa a real possibility he wished that he could somehow build kinship with david 's family so that night he went home and began a new painting he painted the word allah with intricately intertwined persian letter the first three letter shooting up to give the illusion of stripe and the tashdid overhead peppered with glitter to resemble fifty sparkling star `` this is for you my friend '' he presented the painting to david before class the next day `` it is a little gift that i made it is the muslim god but if you turn it sideways it kind of look like an american flag in islam we are all considered brother '' he gave david 's shoulder a tender squeeze `` give my love to your family will you '' david turned white a a ghost he stared wideeyed at the painting turning it this way and that way to admire it `` this is uh incredible '' he muttered `` i am glad you like it '' `` how did you even do this '' `` i have been painting for a while '' david 's expression softened and he fumbled over his word trying to say thank you he squared up and gave jalil a firm handshake `` you know my father paint too he volunteer at the va hospital and paint portrait of wounded veteran '' `` that is great '' jalil said `` i would love to check out his work sometime '' that weekend david sent jalil a wonderful email about how much his family loved the painting and how they would hung it up in their living room jalil called his father in a cheerful mood to relay what had happened but his father wa not pleased `` you know i do not care for artistic foolishness '' his father said `` but dad i am telling you the family is really happy this is a good thing '' `` we are on the brink of war and instead of stepping up to be a leader you are over there drawing picture '' `` i am trying to build connection dad and i think i am- '' the line clicked and jalil knew that his father had hung up he stood stockstill rubbing his eye in frustration he wished that his father could have seen the unexpected jubilation on david 's face the glint of confidence in his eye when he would shaken jalil 's hand it wa obvious that the painting had moved him but jalil wa so shaken up now that he did not know whether he would made the right decision the next day when jalil wa eating lunch in the cafeteria the evening news blaring from the tv mounted on the wall showed iran 's president signing some paper along with four jetblack plane flying menacingly over the ocean the caption beneath read `` consensus reached but b52 bomber send a clear and unmistakable message '' jalil grinned he knew exactly what would happen the bomber would fly around aimlessly for a while and some kind of navy battleship the us somethingorother would be stationed near the persian gulf for a few month just to make it look like something wa going on but there would be no aggression no military intervention it wa all a show a bunch of political theatre somewhere his father wa probably sitting crosslegged against a cushion sipping tea in front of the television and smiling at his colleague at all of the bigwig cleric who would take credit for having thwarted an american attack they would joke that america wa all pomp and pretense no longer a global hegemon capable of policing the world and that the islamic republic wa an emerging power that sent shiver down western spine more than anything jalil thought about his painting and his father his father would probably spend about two second wondering whether the painting had truly made a difference and that two second wa all jalil needed to feel inspired to know that he wa not just an aghazade but an artist capable of enacting great change a few week later at the end of the semester jalil found a package in front of his apartment door it wa from david he opened it and saw that it wa a painting of a man lying in a hospital bed with an american flag draped over him like a blanket his head bandaged and his casted leg propped up on a few pillow he wa staring ahead smirking and holding up two finger a sign that jalil knew meant peace",
    "LosAngelesBarCrawl": "1 he begin in a bar in santa monica in the early evening a gastropub that serf burger and beer though he only ha beer first a lager from a local brewery that he find a little too light and fruity and then a pale ale modeled on something from england which ha a nice caramel bitterness that leaf him feeling pleasantly at ease a if he will sink into the cushion on his seat and get swallowed up by the soft fabric on the patio across from him facing the street and illuminated by the passing headlight sit three guy about ten year younger than him somewhere in their early twenty talking excitedly and laughing wildly and slapping each other on the back a field of empty glass spread out on the table between them they make ahmed think of his own friend from college how they used to go to bar like this one the effortlessness of conversation walking home afterwards and feeling a if life would always be this way he finish his last beer in one long bitter swig and then signal the waitress for the check above him the sky is turning red with the sinking sun 2 next he take the metro all the way downtown deciding on a whim to go to a brewery in the art district where he used to go all the time when he lived on that side of the city it is a large space in a converted warehouse and by the time he arrives the sun ha set and the red brick building look striking against the dark sky the neon sign making him feel a jolt in his chest reminding him of day year ago now when he and amy would come here and sit in a corner booth for hour talking and laughing with the easy banter of a new relationship then stumble out hand in hand kissing in the warm night a they waited at street corner for the light to change or in the doorway of office building their body pressed against the dark glass but now when he go inside he feel a strange loneliness the bar is crowded and he ha trouble signaling the waiter and when he finally order his earlier buzz is gone and he feel a headache coming on from the back of his neck he drink his beer quickly while standing at the bar an ipa that he find a little too strong afterwards he order a belgian sour and sip it slowly while checking his phone feeling self conscious that he is the only person here by himself and trying not to stare at the couple across the bar both of them older than he is but gazing into each other 's eye with a passion that he ha not felt for a long long time on his phone he pull up the email he sent earlier to the tutoring company where he worked subject line `` two week notice '' he would asked them to raise his pay rate but they would refused citing budgetary issue it is a tough economic time we all have to make sacrifice in a rage he would quit sending the email before he could second guess himself now in the dim light pop music from his childhood playing over the speaker and echoing off the exposed pipe and the high ceiling he wonder if it wa the right decision he ha nothing else lined up no private tutoring client no freelance writing gig -- just a modest saving account that likely will not last more than a few month he put his phone away and finish his beer and then signal the bartender for the check 3 from there he walk downtown stop at a taco truck for a quick dinner and then on a whim duck into a cocktail bar on the ground floor of an expensive hotel a narrow rectangular space with dim lighting emanating from low hanging chandelier and a chessboard wall that give the place the vibe of a child 's dollhouse it is packed with men and woman in business suit here for an afterwork drink and ahmed hears snippet of conversation about project deadline and hr department the sole overworked bartender is a guy in a stylish buttondown and skinny jean who look like he play bass in a band part time ahmed feel a twinge of sympathy for someone pursuing an artistic career like himself before remembering that he himself ha not written anything for year not since his literary agent dropped him after the novel he would written failed to get picked up by a major publisher he order a daiquiri which is the special that night and he find it surprisingly good so much so that he order two more and drink them relatively quickly now he is very drunk and he leaf the bar in a haze stumbling past a group of woman in pantsuit who give him a concerned look the light of the chandelier at once too bright and too dim 4 he can go home now back to his apartment watch a tv show or an old movie or just masturbate to some porn and then go to bed but now that he is drunk he is decided why not stay out celebrate quitting his job his fucking job that he never liked anyway -- so he take an uber to silver lake and go to a bar on sunset a hipster place with lot of people his age woman in stylish denim and leather jacket men in patterned halfsleeve button down everyone drinking cocktail and talking in california accent the familiar rhythm of millennial upspeak that once again make him think of his life year before when he would first moved to la and gone out in group like the one he saw at the table around him having serious conversation about book and writing and art but when he sits down in a corner table and sip the old fashioned he is ordered through a plastic straw all he can think of is how he came here with amy after they were married in those honeymoon year how they sat at this very table leaned close the scent of her perfume clouding out all other scent her voice drowning out all other voice now all he can do is concentrate on those other voice each one reminding him of amy he open up facebook on his phone before remembering that she doe not have a profile and this leaf him wondering what her life is like now whether she is happy or whether she cry at night like he doe whether she sits in her new apartment and remembers the night they would decided to divorce that terrible night under the glaring light of their kitchen their voice hoarse from another long fight amy 's eye red with tear her repeated declaration `` i can not do this anymore '' and `` you have become so bitter and angry '' echoing in his ear that all happened a year ago but tonight in the bar he think of it like it wa yesterday and he is so overwhelmed with sadness that he only ha this one drink and afterwards stumble out into the street shielding his eye from the glare of the streetlamp 5 he walk for a while back down sunset and towards downtown and in echo park he duck into a dive bar that he remembers going to once with his old friend veronica who died in a car crash two year ago she would been complaining about her girlfriend rebecca how they would tried to do an open relationship but how it had left them so bitter and jealous but in those year because ahmed and amy were happy all ahmed did wa offer tepid word of comfort now he sits at the bar his elbow accidentally resting in a puddle of beer a soggy receipt for over 100 clinging to his jacket he order a shot of whiskey and drink it quickly but instead of ordering another he think of veronica how sudden the news wa how guilty he would felt for not reaching out before he worry he would been a bad friend when she would needed him most 6 from therehe take an uber to the miracle mile and eats a burrito at a stand he remembered going to year ago -- then afterwards he wanders into a new brewery that is just opened up in an old car dealership an oldfashioned modernist building that date back to the 1950s it is an awe inspiring incredible place high ceiling loud music bright light people everywhere but behind them ahmed can still envision the car dealership a it once wa the place on the tiled floor where the salesman 's desk would have sat the center platform where a glamorous new model might be displayed the wall with faded mark where advertisement must have hung -- all of it now disappeared a prior century transformed by the brutal progress of history everyone is so young here he notice so young in white tshirts that cling to their perfect body crop top showing off their flat stomach high waisted jean that look a elegant a evening dress on their lithe body everyone dancing wildly pounding shot yelling at each other over the electronic track making out in corner table touching each other on the shoulder and the waist and the chest even while they wait at the bar to order ahmed squeeze through the throng and order a beer and a whiskey and then go outside and sits at a table out here it is still crowded people smoking cigarette and clustered around the small table laughter piercing the night in sharp spear of sound but the music is dampened by the thick wall of the old building and the cool night air feel refreshing against his skin he sip his beer and stare at the row of building across the busy street the palm tree silhouetted behind them looking to him like figure on a grecian urn cracked faded but somehow still surviving even after all these year 7 he take the bus from the car dealership to culver city feeling relaxed in the front seat leaning his head back against the glass the up and down rhythm of the bus strangely soothing to his stomach when he disembarks he walk for a bit before going into a karaoke bar that he would gone to with amy for one of her friend 's birthday a small place in a strip mall that make him think of the suburb where he grew up he doe not sing anything tonight but instead just sits at the bar order a simple lager and listens while an indianamerican guy his age sings a song that ahmed remembers listening to in high school crooning out the melody with a heartfelt intensity and then ending with a bow to wild applause from the crowd 8 from there ahmed walk for a while down venice boulevard the car drifting by on his left their headlight shimmering in the darkness the palm tree and power line swaying in the wind a if the whole world is slowly moving back and forth around him eventually he reach an old speakeasythemed bar the sign glowing in the dark like a familiar landmark on a long stretch of highway it is past midnight now and the place is mostly empty but it will be open for another two hour and there are regular there sitting alone at table or at the bar in pair talking quietly while soft jazz play ahmed know the wood paneling is probably no older than a decade but he like to imagine it is been salvaged from an actual speakeasy a bar from the 1880s that somehow survived prohibition but then shuttered in the 1980s in the face of global capitalism he sits on a stool at the bar and order a brandy which he drink slowly trying to savor the taste he think about his novel a multigenerational family saga which had begun in the early 20th century part one a story of his grandfather 's life in pakistan he would researched it so meticulously looking at old photograph spending hour at the library reading book and newspaper article making timeline at his desk at home poster pasted to the wall with all the complex politics he would hoped to capture but for whatever reason he would missed something -- something fundamental in the story some kind of heart 9 he take an uber back towards his apartment in west la but decides last minute to go to one final bar in westwood a place he would once frequented a a student at ucla the kind of establishment that did not card and served cheap beer in pitcher and had big tv that always broadcast espn at this time of night it is still crowded with student ahmed sits at the bar and order a beer and then notice a student beside him talking animatedly to his friend a brown guy just like him perhaps indian or pakistani but possibly middle eastern or iranian too it is hard to hear exactly what they are talking about and ahmed catch only snippet but what is more important is the way the guy look -- there is an earnestness in his expression his wide eye his open mouth the purity of simple and straightforward excitement a with all brown guy his age ahmed feel a slight tinge of recognition wondering at which point their experience mirrored each other -- but he also can not remember the last time he would been so earnest about anything the last time he would had that kind of look in his eye even in that final year with amy he would been so jaded so angry decrying the publishing industry decrying the world perhaps that wa why she left he suddenly think 10 at home he grab a beer from his fridge and then sits at the bar of his kitchen counter opening up his laptop feeling compelled suddenly to write something amy used to sit here he think when they were still together and from the kitchen while he cooked breakfast he could watch her a she worked her bright eye the way she would run her hand through her hair in moment of intense concentration there were still remnant of their life together across this apartment -- a lamp that she would purchased a mug she would given him a a gift her calendar from the previous year that he would been unwilling to take down and that still had her handwriting on it reminder to take her birth control pill and turn in their rent check and call her relative on their birthday but he try not to look at these object even a he think about them instead he open up word on his laptop his mind still fixed on the image of the brown guy in the bar the earnestness of his expression ahmed is more drunk than he is been in a long time and he can feel all the alcohol in his body pounding through his head his bloodstream his heart but he also feel a sense of clarity he ha not felt in a long time a if he is finally understood what wa missing from his early work a if he is unlocked the secret to something profound an idea about life that if he loses he will regret for the rest of his year he take a swig of beer and let u out a breath and then he begin writing",

managed to change the cave had popped up in her sponsored ad it had a dark pixelart interface that looked decidedly retro a callback to '90s anime predicting what the internet would look like in the future the motto wa `` for lover of the underground '' the chat function used avatar sprite like something out of maplestory and everyone listed some kind of internet handle instead of their real name which made it feel a little more like an actual game set in some digital alternate universe and a little le depressing than real life n uploaded two picture into the app her username wa dddgh0st on

than my wife doe he said after a few moment but not so quickly a to be unconfident he added that wa a joke her mother had bought this onestory house in a halffinished development the previous year there wa no father in the picture bush of wild yellow flower dotted the trail along the neighborhood and if she got close enough she could hear the dry hum of bee there were not enough streetlight and night driving wa dangerous the long distance from the city center would have made it hard for the girl to see her old friend if she had had old friend but she had not hung onto her friend anyway her mother wa an emergencyroom physician and wa never home during normal hour since n had moved back mother and daughter passed through the house like two user in an ab test with only the bowl of food she left on the counter and the drip coffee n set to be ready at four pm a the track of each other 's existence it had been almost a year since hillary lost the election since people had cried walking that night on the street of new york and nearly three month since she would left graduate school and found a job off craigslist editing web copy in an airplane hangar she wa giving half of each paycheck to her student loan in the bedroom of this home which wa not her childhood home n lay on the mattress with the red flowerpatterned duvet she would had a a high schooler folded her clothes into the white dresser she had once put her first bra into and drew picture on a wacom tablet at the same desk she would studied for her ap statistic exam when it got dark she lowered all the blind and tried not to feel uneasy at being alone in an empty house on the ground floor at night the air wa genuinely cool and she would take out her favorite of her graduate school sweater then huddle watching anime at her desk and telling herself she wa going to shower and sleep in just ten more minute fifteen ... she would downloaded the cave because she wanted something to happen a few hour after her last message of lol just a she wa getting ready to shower agamemnontheking wrote so what doe a nice disembodied digital ghost like you do for fun haunt tumblr she wrote back play prank on the audio track of youtube video steal webpage and bring up 404 error code he said what a busy life do you ever come out to play in the real world the king lived in a new apartment complex that wa not quite downtown it took her forty minute to get there racing through the empty intersection and the stoplight blinking red and green n thought am i really going is this really going to happen she had never done this before gone to the house of a man she had just met that same day on the internet her car felt like a protective bubble of unreality from the outside world she felt like she wa in a video she could pause at any moment she wa not really inside her body it wa much more plausible to think she wa astral projecting and her real body wa somewhere else in bed sleeping her body wa only dreaming it wa in the car and turning off the exit ramp and stepping on the brake and parallel parking in front of the address she would gotten from agamemnontheking her body wa only dreaming she wa texting him i am outside and checking her reflection in the rearview mirror everything wa a fiction a fantasy imagined by that body still in pajama lying in her bedroom ... agamemnontheking walked out of the sliding glass door in real life he wa short he had sloped shoulder a long neck deep bag under his eye visible under the streetlight then she really wa following him inside up a silent smooth elevator to a living room where there were stack of heavy white book a deep couch framed picture on the wall he wa a little bit uglier than she had thought he would be and this wa comforting and made the scene feel more like playacting the man offered her dry wine in a crystal glass asked her if she wa hungry leaned over the kitchen island pushed her lip open with the edge of the glass the wine wa dry and left a taste of salt on her tongue a she swallowed this the injection of her sense of taste brought the scene more judderingly into reality for her she wa like persephone eating in the underworld he refilled his own glass and something about his hooded eye how they monitored her scared and thrilled her he did not turn on any light in the bedroom there wa more art on the wall in large white frame the shape were fleshy grotesque erotic the whole time she had been smiling joking performing and still she felt it wa not really happening she wa in a cutscene she had to see to the end this is realthis is not real she thought like a coin toss the man laid her on the bed peeled off her sweater ran a finger from her collarbone to her ankle and said `` you are very lovely '' liquid pooled into her underwear which he took off a moment later when he put his finger inside her she thought apropos of nothing of the aviator the dark sunglass observing her under the omniscient and ravaging sun the next morning n drove to work from the man 's house just after dawn she had slept for perhaps three four hour at the diner the lucia berlin waitress came over with the coffee pot `` so early today '' the waitress remarked `` here you go honey '' at work she nodded sleepily over the list of `` 10 way to get the most out of your garden fertilizer '' and `` try these top 5 antivirus software for business professional '' she plucked at her sweater feverishly should she take it off she did not want the others to notice she wa wearing the same tshirt she could still feel the king 's finger in her n 's organ writhed and she squeezed her thigh together a tight a they would go `` it will not let me make any more facebook profile '' the twentyoneyearold said suddenly their bos stood up `` let me see '' `` i am having the same issue '' the twentytwoyearold said from his desk n looked at the article she wa publishing on bestgardenhoseenthusiastcom after she published it she wa supposed to share it on four different social medium platform under fake name she opened the gmail account she would made under the name linda hallberg contributor at bestgardenhoseenthusiast your ip address ha been blocked due to suspicious activity facebook informed her her bos went around the other side of the partition and began rummaging around `` what about you '' the twentyoneyearold asked n but n who had her earphone in pretended she did not hear `` what are we going to do '' the twentyoneyearold asked `` i think he is going to scramble our ip address '' the twentytwoyearold said `` how '' the twentytwoyearold shrugged `` i do not know i just hear that is what people do '' meanwhile n thought gazing at the facebook email no one knew what she had done last night the sex had been good -- so good that remembering it now her leg went weak and she wanted to drive back to the king 's house and repeat everything they had done the previous night right this instant she thought of the boy she had slept with before the awkwardness the selfconsciousness how the sex had at best been almost enjoyable but never quite how distant and unreal they felt now she had come out of the night and left the king 's house alive her bos came back and started fiddling with another device when he bent down the sweat along his hairline glistened under the artificial light like a lick of slime it could not be good for them working in this heat day after day even with the fan on n stared absently at the shiny skin on his forehead the air felt stifling the writhing in her stomach intensified -- wa it the thought of the sex she fanned herself with one hand the light above seemed too bright and the twentytwoyearold asked `` everything all right '' she nodded and scooted her chair directly in front of a fan she wa fine it wa just she felt quite very hot -- and then she wa stumbling out to the parking lot and the twentytwoyearold wa following her asking if she could drive home okay n wa waving him off in the car she checked the rearview mirror and saw her skin wa pallid damp she pulled out of the lot in a reckless swerve through the rear window she could see the aviator who had come out to the deck who wa staring at her car under his black sunglass standing at the porch of the pilot school his gaze made her stomach churn more she stopped the car for a second with an abrupt shuddering of the brake she wanted to step out speak to him but then she saw his foot move wa he going to walk towards her her foot swiveled to the accelerator she wa out on the street she managed barely not to hit the car behind her changing lane off the freeway and in her mother 's house in the halfabandoned neighborhood she wa tugging off her sweater and heading to the toilet and lifting the lid and vomiting out an eggcolored bile -- but why she did not feel ill no it wa good what she felt tingling all over from her belly to her toe yet still -- she lifted water into her mouth from the bathroom sink flushed the toilet realized she had to pee pulled down her pant sat down and saw the smear of blood on the underwear she had not changed from last night oh she had started her period in graduate school she made an animated short titled check this box to verify you are not a robot it started with a tiny girl with an electrical outlet in her back waking up in an empty bedroom the girl the room everything wa sketched out with rough line and no color the scene expanded the girl 's bedroom wa actually an enormous control room with a spread of computer and a thick coaxial cable dangling on the floor the girl plugged herself in and the first monitor turned on her avatar popped up on screen reborn into a new world and this world wa fully realized it had color shape dimension music cottoncandy tree but before long block of gray crept in there were shadow in strange form on the floor of the treehouses the background music turned ominous the screen flickered pixelated square of gray dotted the sky in binary pattern cut to the physical body comatose below the monitor twitching and finally once the dreamy pink world degraded into a sketchy draft version just like the real world outside the avatar found another room with a monitor there wa a new character a man with a fixed smile like a mask his speech scrolled across the screen welcome is not it beautiful here this place it is so lovely i could just stay here forever sit and watch the world go by without me this place it is so lovely i could just stay here forever is not it beautiful here to sit and watch the world without you and the second monitor turned on there wa another world in there full of color that started to bleed out over the edge of the screen green and orange and yellow pumpkin a road the man turned to look the avatar saw the man had no back he wa all face and nothing behind it he wa completely depthless a straight line and the world in the second monitor expanded out and intruded more into the first ... n wa thinking of expanding it into a video game the girl 's avatar would hop through different monitor and their associated world meeting strange figure once people who talked in long string of zero and one or wingdings halfheartedly she wa trying to decide how she wanted the story to end what if there wa an option for the avatar to remain in the monitor forever maybe it wa easier to stay even in those decaying empty place than to emerge into the real world maybe all the character the girl encountered had once been real people who decided to move into the monitor world for good she thought that the girl plugged into the computer probably had some trauma at the back of her life why else would she avoid her real life so hard but n wa not very interested in the `` why '' of thing only the `` what '' and more and more she liked staying in the imagination of the monitor world creating tableau of different world and color palette then ruining them all with a few mouse click the second time she met the king wa on a thursday he called her over late eleven pm and she once again fell into the comforting sense that they were playacting nothing that happened this far into night could be real including their meeting which felt clandestine for no reason he greeted her with a flourless chocolate loaf cake sprinkled with powdered sugar and she wondered what he wa overcompensating for on his couch which wa expensive deep and very comfortable he massaged her calf he had a strong grip `` do you do sport '' she asked he said he had a black belt in judo she felt the thrill of being cared for in a dangerous situation he had a shelf of dvd behind the couch for movie there were name she did not know like 10 to midnight death wish ii basket case cat people for music there were cd the police depeche mode n picked up a dvd and looked at the cover garish and pulpy `` i do not know any of these '' she said `` they are from the 80 classic '' the photo on his wall were of naked body arranged in strange pose against a brutalist landscape of a stark black house the body were thin pale longlegged firm the picture were not sexy -- something about them wa very cold `` what are these porn '' the king laughed `` they are by a japanese photographer he is famous '' `` they are kind of creepy '' nothing wa real which made her bold `` are you creepy '' `` i like them everyone seems like they could turn violent in just a second '' that wa what it wa n thought the feeling she got from him of not knowing whether the next moment would be safe what wa so alluring about being in his company he rubbed her leg and she did not know what he would do next the king slid his hand up her thigh during the night he started snoring with the deep throaty rumble of an old man this punctured the film of unreality and n wanted to leave she shifted restlessly around on the bed one of the small photograph by the japanese photographer wa hung on the wall in the background wa a tiny woman in a ballet pose who seemed about to take off swallowing the foreground wa a man facing her -- his posture the adamant line of his leg and shoulder wa threatening on saturday she wa watching tv on the couch when her phone pinged still recovering from the scratch you gave me the king said the intrusion of the king into her weekend morning wa unwelcome lol she typed though she did not find it very funny he followed up shortly what are you up to i am staying home today not feeling well oh no what is the matter stomach issue where do you live i can bring some soup n paused below her stomach she felt her intestine knotting together again wa he being caring or wa this crossing a line instinctively she did not want the king to know where she lived even if she did not live with her mother she would not have wanted him to know she closed her eye her mind swimming with feverish image the dark highway the white sugar on the chocolate cake the airplane hangar her reflection swimming in the black coffee in the diner ... `` did you eat lunch yet '' her mother 's voice floated into the miasma oh n opened her eye and saw her mother there looking tired it felt like a long time since she would seen her `` sorry mom i forgot to start the coffee '' she moved to the couch and put a hand on n 's forehead `` what is wrong are you feeling sick '' her hand wa cool and dry `` my stomach 's been a little funny '' her mother brought her hand down and squeezed n 's foot hard `` eek '' she squirmed `` mom it is okay i already took some ibuprofen '' but her mother 's grip relaxed her her mother said `` i will make you some ginger tea '' n watched her set a small pot on the stove her mother wa short thin and pale with sensible short hair and a competent nononsense manner even watching her bent over the cutting board n felt protective of her `` how is the hospital '' she asked `` we had a sad case last night this guy brought a girl in with bruise all over her neck and face he said she would fainted '' a whispery feeling ran up n 's skin like walking through a spiderweb `` did he hit her '' `` she said she 'fell ' because she had 'low blood sugar ' and kept asking 'can my boyfriend stay ' '' her mother sighed `` i asked if i could speak to her alone but she would not let him leave '' `` at least he brought her in '' `` these abuser do all sort of thing '' her mother said `` you have to be careful '' she brought the mug to n and smoothed her daughter 's hair when n brought the cup up to her mouth the smell of ginger wa spicy pungent traveling through her nostril up to her brain where she imagined it lighting a tiny fire the king started texting her more through the weekday even when she did not reply think i might need someone to help mount some shelf haha have you heard that one did you eat lunch yet today how is work 3 pm slump i get headache when it is hot like this it is so dry i have a nosebleed at lunch n checked her message in her car sitting outside the hangar she tried to identify what she wa feeling and it wa repulsion she did not like that the king wa trying to talk to her more now it wa needy and made their encounter le flimsy le transactional in the side mirror she saw the door to the pilot school swing open the aviator came out and lit a cigarette it wa hot but there wa no trace of sweat on his starched white shirt n 's cellphone pinged again are you busy tonight this would be the last time n decided the king wa getting boring the fear she had so viscerally felt had been replaced by a kind of pity when she went over it wa raining and only six pm in the cool gray light of his living room the man looked sagged and tired he brought her a small cup she brought it to her mouth took a gulp almost gagged she had not been expecting wine drinking alcohol without having eaten n felt herself growing languid turning her eye onto the man in the earlyevening light she saw the bag under his eye were puffy and there were even a few gray hair at his temple `` what have you been doing all day '' she asked `` watching this old reality show called to catch a predator have you heard of it '' `` no '' n hesitated `` true crime '' `` yeah these pedophile it is so funny '' the man laughed a short ugly laugh had he always had those jowl `` some of them say the craziest shit my favorite one ... '' later in bed after sex which for the first time felt perfunctory and disappointing he told her he wa writing a play `` what is it about '' `` charles manson '' `` the cult guy '' `` he just died you know '' `` he wa still alive i do not even know when all that stuff happened '' the man chuckled `` he wa misunderstood there were a lot of way in which he wa a genius and charismatic the guy wa a leader but everyone only remembers the one thing '' n kept her voice very measured `` but he wa a murderer right '' `` he did not actually kill anyone himself it wa his follower the young woman '' suddenly the king lunged at her stomach and tickled her `` girl can be scary '' his voice turned highpitched incongruously childish n wanted to ease away from his circling hand `` so what is the new thing about the play '' she tried to change the subject `` like how is it different from what actually happened '' `` i am thinking of having all the part played by child twelve and under '' `` like charles manson and all the woman and everyone are just going to be kid '' `` do not you think it would be cute all lord of the fly inherent brutality of humanity and all that '' his voice had turned crueler talking about the child she did not like the way he sounded she imagined a young kid on stage artlessly acting out an orgy she felt tense her hand tingled `` i am going home '' she said a moment later she sounded very natural `` got to make dinner '' `` you sure '' he smiled `` you are welcome to sleep here if you want you know '' `` i want to sleep in my own bed '' `` what is your bed like '' n turned her head `` that is a weird question '' `` i am curious how you live '' the king said also sitting up and kissing her on the cheek `` all right i will walk you out '' sitting in her car parked on the curb she tried the key again and again `` shit '' she took the key out shoved it back in turned it again `` it is not starting '' `` i can jump it '' the king said `` do not worry '' while she waited for him to come back she wondered if she should call her mother but nothing ha happened she told herself nothing ha happened he had not said anything she could point to a obviously sketchy she remembered the excitement she would felt the first night meeting him he had been an unknown she had felt the rush of getting away with something there wa the way he would looked at her over the food he gave her the first night his eye hooded intent obviously monitoring how much she drank the casual way he put his hand on the back of her head when she wa giving him oral there wa no pushing but there wa the suggestion that if he wanted to he could no one knew she wa here `` i have got it '' the king said from behind her he insisted on following her in his car `` no no '' n said shaking her head `` it is fine i am just going home it is a long drive do not worry '' then she bit her tongue wishing she would said she wa expected somewhere else `` i will just go along with you a little bit to make sure there is no problem what if your car dy again '' `` i have triple a '' she lied `` do not worry '' the king laughed under the streetlight his teeth were not very even `` i am not busy it is not any trouble '' `` you really do not have to '' n shrunk away then because she wa still alone with him on the sidewalk and she wa afraid to be rude she said giving an excuse `` i live with my parent so ... '' he did not seem surprised `` i will not come in '' he promised `` i will not even stop i will just see you park and make sure everything 's good and drive right off '' he will not take no for an answer she thought on the drive back her arm were locked in so closely to her body she could feel the tightness of her inner elbow in the rearview mirror she saw the king in a chevy tahoe trailing closely behind her there wa heavy traffic she tried to subtly lose his car but every time she changed lane he reappeared on her left or a car or two to the side then directly behind her skimming along confidently he wa wearing black sunglass so she could not see his eye a though he knew she wa looking at him in her mirror he suddenly grinned i am never going to see him again she thought the world seemed too real now n pulled off the freeway early the stop wa near a plaza with a frozenyogurt chain and yoga franchise in high school she would come here after track practice n swallowed hard the tahoe pressed behind her she kept driving trying not to look around too much or go too slowly she saw a side road with a stone sign and turned there wa a parking garage some neat shrub outside without looking at the number she pulled into a spot in the second between the death of the engine and the shriveling of her seatbelt a black hole opened inside her lung she opened the door his car wa idling behind hers she prayed whoever belonged in the actual spot did not show up `` well '' the king said rolling his window down and looking at her without taking the sunglass off `` everything look good '' `` yup '' n forced herself to smile `` nice little neighborhood '' `` yeah '' the king looked around and said `` no one 's here come here a sec '' unwillingly n approached the car window he pulled her face in by the chin and kissed her on the lip `` see you next time '' god his lip are dry she thought and too thick disgust ran down her esophagus and she had to stop herself from wiping her mouth `` next time '' she said easily and with enormous invisible effort lifted the corner of her mouth she brought her hand up and waved surely he wa not going to wait to see her unlock a door and go into one of the house no thank god he wa not the king rolled his window back up and smiled his unpleasant smile at her again he pressed the gas on his car looped through the roundabout and exited the neighborhood by the time n got back to her real home it wa dark she would waited for ten minute in the parking garage hiding in the back seat of her car with the light turned off in case the king for whatever reason decided to come back then she would driven aimlessly for nearly two hour going the wrong direction on purpose before pulling into a gas station filling up and at last setting her route to home from the moment she would peeled from the curb in front of the king 's apartment until now she had not let herself think or feel too much now her head felt hot and her heart strangled inside her airless blackhole torso she put a hand on the wall to steady herself then she turned on every single light in the house and went around pulling down the blind one by one avoiding her reflection in the dark pane avoiding looking through the window to anything beyond because because what in her bedroom she locked the door why are you feeling so scared there is nothing to be scared of she told herself she forced herself to shower and pull on her favorite sweater she took out her laptop and got into bed she opened a video game her avatar ran around a dirt field shooting little pixie zombie who turned dark green then purple when they were hit in the brain the soundtrack wa a cheerful piano medley gradually n felt sleepiness overtake her she became aware she wa hungry she had not eaten her eye grew heavy on the pillow i do not have to decide right now she thought what i feel also nothing happened she thought maybe i wa just being paranoid she drifted off with the sound on her computer still going and all the light in her room still on perhaps because of that or because her sweater made her too hot her dream were fitful and all through the night she could not quite tell if she wa fully asleep or halfawake her stomach hurt in the bathroom no vomit came out when she walked outside there were noticeably fewer bee than there would been in the middle of summer nothing had happened nothing had happened she typed his name into google first name city theatre first name city name of a university on a hoodie she had seen in his closet a reverse image search of his profile photo from the cave nothing his invisibility on the internet cemented how little she knew about him an air of doubt had crept into her searching that she had ever met him or driven to his house that she had lain on her back in a dark room with pale photograph on the wall ... first name charles manson first name japanese photographer no hit she blocked the king 's number she started avoiding her phone started turning the radio on when she wa driving started driving faster started looking out for a black chevy tahoe she started eating her lunch inside the hangar started leaving work later started not wanting to be alone started wanting witness he would not be able to find her he had not come to her house they only knew each other 's first name the fear she felt only in his apartment only when she had wanted to feel it wa oozing through the crack in her bedroom wall and made her afraid when driving at night a week later it wa just her and the twentytwoyearold in the hangar their bos had left for lunch their mouse click echoed into the silence she could not focus on the horticulturalisttipsforsinglemomscom article coiled claustrophobia threatened to pop every blood vessel in her body stealthily breaking the rule she had set for herself seeing the twentytwoyearold immersed in a youtube video that clearly wa not about his assigned topic bestmixedmartialartsgear she opened a private browser and continued searching for the king online first name phone number his first name had an unusual spelling `` hey '' the twentytwoyearold said into the dead air of the hangar `` did you bring lunch or do you want to go out and get something '' `` mmmm '' she nonanswered and there -- in an online directory the first result on the search engine -- were three hit something she clicked on the page the directory wa like an online yellow page there were full name address phone number even date of birth all this information just available with some swipe on the keyboard the first two result were people with different spelling of his first name and who lived too far away the last result wa the name of the man who must be the king the street address wa the one she had driven to he wa a real person the date of birth listed wa 1975 she felt her intestine writhing again like snake pressure ballooned inside her head n logged onto facebook she wa still using the linda hallberg fake account she typed the full name she had found into the search bar there wa one in arizona one in colorado one in hong kong and there sixth one on the list the facebook profile with the same blackandwhite photo from the cave in the introduction box the name of the city they lived in the name of a liberalarts college in vermont not the one from the hoodie and a graduation year -- 1997 she counted backward in her head he must be at least a decade older than he had said she pushed her chair back `` yes let u go get lunch '' she said to the twentytwoyearold though it had been a long pause though it wa too late to respond the twentytwoyearold whose name wa kevin looked at her a little surprised a well he might she thought because she had been unsociable for more than two month he turned out to be gracious `` cool the diner '' n drove them the four minute to lunch in her car the aviator wa standing outside the door of the pilot school smoking in the diner the tv news played a story about a woman who had escaped her father 's cult the lucia berlin waitress brought them glass of ice water `` hi honey '' she said to n `` this your coworker '' kevin wa short baby faced and very very normal he wa originally from texas and had studied business merchandising he speculated on their bos their job how much longer it could possibly last `` i mean it is not like we are making money but what are you going to do when he run out of cash '' `` oh i did not think about that '' n could barely chew on her burrito out of habit she had asked for a black coffee `` you were in new york right '' kevin went on `` but your family 's here '' `` my mom '' n said `` and i did not want to leave her alone '' `` at least you know people here my parent moved here in the middle of college '' what people n thought people with real life i do not know anyone with a real life `` i do not know a lot of people i wa seeing someone for a bit i just stopped '' `` i am sorry to hear that '' kevin stopped then asked since she wa clearly waiting for him to `` any particular reason or ... '' `` well '' n hesitated `` i started feeling like there were some thing that did not add up ... like some of the thing he said ... '' the thought congealed inside her the king 31 occupation theatre if he wa born in 1975 he wa fortytwo year old some of the thing he would said about her body which she would found so flattering and oldfashioned now she thought he might have said them because he wa so much older how had she let him touch her what sign had she missed and what sign had she seen and let go had he done this before the first night had not he been so confident so relaxed how many young woman had he seduced what kind of man ... `` i mean he did not do anything wrong '' she said half question `` technically except ... '' `` no no '' kevin leaned forward shaking his head he had very pale fine eyelash in his baby face `` trust your intuition you feel like you can not trust what he say like you have been lied to -- no matter what that is not a good way to enter a relationship '' he crooked a smile `` i am sure your mom would want you to be careful '' the overhead light clarified the tiny bubble at the edge of the coffee suddenly n wanted to cry in the rush of everything that had happened since she moved home her unhappiness her frustration the recklessness with which she would met the king she would forgotten -- she wa someone is daughter a beloved daughter and her mother would be sad if she were hurt in the car on the way back to the hangar they were silent on a loop in her mind n recalled the time the king had touched her she felt disgusted but she had also let herself enjoy it she could not lie to herself and say she had not liked it at least in the beginning how horrible that she had let herself be touched by him those time had been so eager even -- `` i have never actually seen a plane take off from here '' kevin mused looking out the window where the roof of the pilot school wa coming into view the thought of the aviator being there watching her from behind dark glass infuriated her she turned into the parking lot with the chainlink fence in the rearview mirror she saw the pressed pant the white shirt still there `` that man is always fucking creeping on me '' kevin turned his neck `` who that person standing over there '' n turned the wheel sharply `` he is always looking at me when i am out here '' she said or thought she said but her organ were writhing again and that feverdream miasma -- black coffee sunglass tv news pale body black house chocolate loaf cake a cup of wine -- wa crowding her thought she thought of the girl wandering inside the monitor world she wanted the body to wake up she wanted the body to feel safe what had she been doing all this time her hand tightened on the wheel clang -- and then n wa coming to herself kevin yelping `` oh my god what are you doing '' and when the car wa stopped she saw she had rolled into the chainlink fence her engine wa still running and kevin wa unbuckling his seatbelt and opening the door and the aviator wa walking over taking off his sunglass and saying in a light voice she had never heard `` are you okay '' n opened her mouth to yell something at the aviator something like back off or get away from me but no word came only a choke of surprise coming up to her window -- framed by the blue sky concerned and kindly underneath the black sunglass that a slender hand held aloft to the side -- wa the innocent and naked face of a young woman",
    "HongmenBanquet": "the private banquet room wa raucous adrift with the sound of popping oil and clinking glass the waitress noted that most of the diner already bore tomatored cheek their face flushed from the flow of erguotoyou and rice wine while her colleague busied herself with refilling the glass -- only for them to slosh over and empty a the customer toasted again -- she brought in two more dish and placed them on the lazy susan blooming with plate that had been half plucked the patriarch wa treating whether or not he would be the one to pay -- if he would be beaten by another relative slyly passing a credit card under the table -- wa another question with large party like this there were always at least three attendee tripping over themselves in their effort to foot the bill in the few month of her waitressing career she had witnessed family sitting at cleared table for hour arguing over the check elbow knocking into face in their effort to prove filial piety the patriarch had ordered half the menu and server continued to stream into the room their arm warm from the underside of porcelain plate guo bao royou square slice of pork garnished with garlic and drizzled in shaoxing cooking wine fish head fried in oil their filmy eye gazing blankly at the mouth that would bury them long doughy noodle for longevity soaked in chili oil and red vinegar slurped down burnt throat `` this is a homecoming '' he would announced to the girl who took the order `` do not let our mouth or cup go empty '' the piece de resistance of the feast wa a thirteenpound roast suckling pig it leg were splayed out comically on the platter a if the creature had been drawn and quartered the resemblance it face once had to a pig had been burned away -- it eye charred slit it snout shriveled from heat they decorated the corpse with orange slice of persimmon and clementine piece of pineapple a bed of napa cabbage though not heavy the platter wa large and unwieldy and had to be carried by two waitress they nearly spilled the pig into a girl lap a they lifted the platter over her head and onto the table the waitress observed that this girl sitting closest to the door wa an abc she would passed the back of her head that sheet of dyed blonde hair enough time to know the few abc she encountered seemed indignant to be exposed a outsider thinking they could sink into chinese society without so much a a ripple picking an american out of the crowd wa easy even if they wore a chinese face the tell were there her mandarin wa clunky and devoid of a regional accent she wore a thin strappy dress that revealed tanned shoulder the hair most damning wa that she had choked on her first glass of erguotoyou resulting in a continuous cough soothed only by an entire bowl of rice chopstick frantic a she shoveled the grain into her mouth looking to scrape the burning from her tongue the waitress silently brought a second bowl of white rice placing it at her side with large watery eye set in a sickly face she turned to her and said in english `` thank you '' forgetting where she wa which wa how the waitress knew the erguotoyou wa working may extended family wa northern born and bred in jilin since it wa called manchuria which meant that the act of knocking back erguotoyou wa instinctual an inherited muscle memory in the brutal winter chill and slant snow cutting down to the bone warmth came from a glass the pooling of bai jiu in the stomach lent heat when heat wa too expensive or firewood too dry in the summer swamplike and sticky they chased away their discomfort with drink ankle swollen from cluster of mosquito bite heat stroke frostbite -- all malady that could be cured by a generous pour the chinese phrase for cheer is gan bei to dry your cup may wa learning that the li family took this very seriously and several aunt and uncle had been checking her shot glass inspecting for wayward drop refusing her protestation the relative plied her with shot after shot toasting to her arrival after three shot she had learned her lesson if she came up for air before the bottom wa bone dry she would be forced to take another full drink once she downed the proffered drink she made sure the underside wa bone dry so that she could see her reflection warped face now green with nausea stretched eye converging in a tiny pointed chin may could no longer feel her mouth sensation swallowed up by the acridness of the alcohol a halfblind baidu search beneath the table revealed that erguotoyou a bai jiu distilled from sorghum wa 100proof still the heat and bitterness were foreign different from the fraternityserved everclear that she had once tried at university warmer too than the overpowering smell of bleach her grandfather -- seventy with the carcass of six shot glass spread before him -- seemed unaffected rosacea blistered his cheek in a permanent flush she could never tell if he wa drunk or sober may remembered that in high school her english class had read the canterbury tale her teacher had taught them that the wife of bath red complexion wa a marker for her promiscuity her lust too much blood she had explained meant having a sanguine temperament among the four humor in the case of may lao ye the medieval theory proved true may mother wa one of seven child two were legitimate sibling but the rest were bastard raised in shadow by single mother some of these halfsiblings had found their way back to lao ye in the last decade and this exposed secret wa why her grandfather and may mother were estranged why may mother had protested against may planned graduation trip to her homeland a fight so intense that may had blacked out she circled the memory of it resolution like tub water around the drain the moment a strange lacuna that wa just outside of may grasp -- may wa poured another shot and forced to down it amidst cheer of gan bei the round table wa crammed to bursting with li from different family line reaching over one another to spin the lazy susan and serve themselves their preferred dish some of them only shared an ancestor three generation back may wa unable to differentiate between these distant cousin and her maternal uncle and aunt her mother halfsiblings may referred to all the relative a shushu or ayi men were shushu woman were ayi lai lai lai an ayi said using her chopstick to gesture toward may empty plate may dutifully handed it to her and the ayi began to pile the plate high with pinch of dish twicecooked pork chicken stewed with mushroom peking duck wrapped in a pancake pork and cabbage wonton to top it off a roughcut slab of the roast pig riddled with fat deposit hao le hao le may laughed enough enough ai ya the aunt exclaimed tai shoyou le too skinny other relative nodded in agreement may laughed again the sound halfstrangled she knew that if she were not a thin a she wa they would chide her prodding her with an ai ya xu yao jian fei you must lose weight her mother had said this when may wa eleven and baby fat pillowed over her bone her round cheek culminating in a round body that spoke of preadolescence under her mother roof she wa fed scrap all through high school the peeled white of egg the skin of tomato the gut of a nearly hollowed sweet potato eventually she found comfort in the way her finger slotted between her rib weaned on hunger she craved it familiarity -- the gnawing acidity shoring up along the side of her stomach a daily lullaby skinny just like fang a shushu said another ayi clucked her tongue you could never put meat on fang she wa born in the winter january the coldest month a slippery wonton kept wriggling out of may chopstick like an earthworm burrowing back into the ground after being brought out by the rain she left it wilting at the bottom of her full bowl what doe being born in the winter have to do with it may asked mei guo mei mei -- american little sister -- in jilin when your mother wa born you could not even fill a baby belly in the winter an uncle answered yes you should feel lucky to have so much food in front of you an older relative lectured the older generation smiled at her nodded encouragingly to her plate -- a signal for her to eat they chewed with their mouth open and in their smile they showed may glint of digestion through the slat of their yellow teeth not wanting to appear thankless may picked at a piece of duck forcing a closelipped smile a she chewed her mouth punctured the crisp papery skin sunk into a cushion of fat she held back a gag a she swallowed it softness here have some more fish a shushu offered plopping a full fish head into her rice bowl it unblinking eye surveyed her a she politely buried it taxidermic gaze under the starch of rice used to be the only place you could get seafood up here wa through dalian the shushu said but now we can eat seafood just like the south he picked up a shrimp it pink fetal curve wrapped around a chopstick and ate it in one bite -- she will eye and all another ayi sighed do you remember how we used to prepare for the winter and now so much food in jilin you could gorge yourself to death on it she wa around may mother age but her hair wa bone white root and all the ceiling light that bounced off it whiteness made may pupil constrict so many blister from digging a shushu groaned we used to have to bury our vegetable the whitehaired ayi explained to may a she leaned over to pour her more rice wine each fall a truck would come to u from the countryside carrying thousand of jin of napa cabbage winter radish potato if you had the money you could buy your vegetable early dig out your dirt cellar before the ground got too hard we never had the money a shushu said with a full mouth his chortle becoming a choke someone slapped his back hard we would get the thin harvest and have to spend a day carving out three meter from halffrozen dirt and if we could not dig deep enough we would have to pickle the rest no apple for u an uncle said shaking his head wealthier family could get hundred of jins of apple for the winter but we were too poor to afford sweet thing our tongue were made for dirt and bark and starvation your mother used to refuse to dig the cellar or dig up the snow when ma needed vegetable from the cellar your mother wa afraid the manual labor would harden her hand leave her cheek chapped and peeling from windburn beauty wa more important to her and it wa a currency she wa rich in well see now how it paid off she is in america and we are here her vanity got her further than our labor ai ya an older ayi cut in shaking her head how can you say such shallow thing about a mother to her daughter may and her mother shallowness were intimate friend may wanted to say she did not mind but the ayi barreled on mei mei she began do not pay attention to their drunken bitterness they have become too modern too western do not forget that filial piety to your mother is the most important virtue in fuzhoyou where my husband is from they have an entire festival to celebrate mother aojiu festival this ayi also had white hair cut short and permed so that the curl clung close to her head she wore two cardigan buttoned over one another and seemed to be in her sixty ma the ayi sitting next to may groaned aojiu festival is not only about filial piety and how would you know may blinked the film from her eye observing the woman next to her underneath the neatly styled white hair wa a young face no more than thirtyfive the skin around her eye wa unlined free from crow foot the young aunt ignoring her mother smiled kindly at may aojiu festival celebrates the dead like today hungry ghost festival we northerner celebrate by burning hell bank note and paper house for our dead then we ply our family ghost with different food duck twicecooked pork a whole chicken fried fish four kind of fruit but in fuzhou they nourish their dead with aojiu porridge she raised a challenging gaze to her mother did you dye your hair may blurted out it wa a drunk thought that became a drunk digression she had been studying the aunt closely the color mirrored her mother white to the hue but she wa too young to have started graying the ayis hand flew to her hair touching the fine strand she seemed surprised at the question mouth opening and closing silently like a fish around them conversation petered out they turned their attention to the ayis answer the silence that ensued unnatural may looked around confused by how the texture of the room had changed the aunt white head bowed sheepishly under the scrutiny i do not know if i am the right person to tell mei mei this story if she should hear it all aunt and uncle exchanged look with one another -- their pupil flickering to each side -- unsure how to answer at last lao ye said quietly mei mei should know what the japanese did to our family so it wa law and the aunt began to tell the story five generation before you may our family lived in the northernmost part of jilin near the village of hailin your lao yes grandmother your greatgrandmother had three son before lao yes father they were good son all that poverty and hunger and it just made them kind it wa the winter of 1933 they had run out of food so their mother took them into the neighboring wood they scavenged for willow bud which is what the goose ate in the winter while she wa sifting her hand through the snow for whatever life she could eat she heard the indent of foot nearby when she looked up she saw her younger brother whom her eldest son had taken after the unruly black hair the square jaw the red lip that she had once teased him for but he had enlisted in the antijapanese volunteer army and died a few month ago this brother wore a straw hat and a thin white kimono but he had the same mannerism he tugged at the finger of his other hand impatiently smoothed his hair anxiously so she could not help but approach him when he extended a hand even though an innate part of her knew he wa a gui -- a ghost this wa her first mistake he wa not gui but oni -- a japanese demon brought to the mainland by the kwantung army he lived with the doctor and officer in hailin where they had established unit 643 a sister branch to 731 in pingfang the oni did the doctor bidding because they would struck a deal they fed him the body of their failed experiment to keep their war crime hidden what did the oni care if his meat had been infected with anthrax for all the century he had been alive he had never seen so many body laid out for him like a feast the japanese had no use for the corps after they had died they called the chinese maruta -- lumber -- and they said they were just felling tree clearing the forest and the oni -- well he had gotten used to gluttony so he stayed in hailin the doctor and officer alike had asked him to bring back a woman preferably of childbearing age but they would take a girl too he had seen the woman in the forest and though she had little meat on her bone she had red in her cheek and long dark hair and he knew the men would be pleased he saw that she wore a mourning band on her left sleeve so he shifted into her loss at first she came willingly but but she knew her brother hand from the year of leading him around and this wa not his hand she began to thrash and scream yelling for her son to run but the oni wa strong and he dragged her through the snow leaving a trench dug by her body in their wake her eldest son saw his mother being pulled to hailin and he hid his younger brother in a hollow tree deep in it root so that the underground would keep them warm he ignored her warning and chased after her when the japanese men saw the mother they were pleased but they did not take her like they had so many other woman always in cell always at gunpoint instead they had devised a new experiment a hybrid child they made the oni shift into it true form eight foot tall skin a blue a frostbite a jaw a wide a her head yawning open it revealed a set of sharp canine two horn spun out of it head and when she wanted to die from this sight they had it consume her rutting it hip into her it threefingered hand leaving bruise the color of it skin on the bone of her pelvis the mother lost consciousness she believed she would died and her spent body mimicked death so well that the japanese threw her out in the snow -- a maruta not even worth kindling now just another failed experiment the son had been trailing the mother and the oni their deep track easy to follow he saw it take her into the facility and he lingered in the surrounding wood waiting for dark but the oni wa not the only yokai at hailin they had brought over a yukionna for the doctor hypothermia experiment like the oni they had lured her in by the sheer number of body a line of men in the snow that she could freeze to death whose soul she could slurp up through their blued lip sometimes the doctor had her leave them alive freezing a limb until a finger or toe fell off the doctor liked watching the skin of the maruta turn black under the yukionnas breath hit the frozen limb with his cane until the sound wa the same a a thwack against wood that day there were no frostbite experiment so the yukionna drifted in the cold where she wa comfortable the son did not see her because she had white skin and wore a white kimono blending in with the winter landscape she saw him and because she wa hungry she did not bother freezing him before sucking at his life her teeth notched into his soul tugging but when she faced him she saw that he wa just a boy not a man an innocent and her mouth opened in that small bite she had already leeched out the color from his hair leaving it a white a her skin the boy tore himself away from the yukionna and his soul dropped back into his body when he looked up she wa gone icicle in the place she had been floating now every li descended from this eldest son is born with white hair that missing heirloom still pickled in a demon belly the son saw his mother stripped of her clothes thrown in the snow when it wa dark he carried her to the tree with his brother and waited out the night before going home her eye were gaping open jellied but there wa no familiarity there she had let the whitehaired boy tug her away though she did not know who he wa she remained in this chrysalis -- her son fed her broth closed her open eye at dusk -- until she reached the third trimester at which time she woke in chinese numerology the number four si is unlucky because it sound like the character for death si this fourth son growing in her belly wa unlucky for other reason for the last two month before she would give birth she tried to kill him in the womb she gathered thuja safflower silver wormwood and crushed them into her tea which she drank daily but he would not die if he would not die then maybe he would survive the north after all when he wa born she loved him unwillingly she saw that he wa still halfhuman half her his skin wa the color of moss -- blue and yellow mixed -- a if his whole body wa covered by a mongolian mark the two bump on his hairline the only other sign that something wa amiss this you see wa your lao yes father oh dear we have upset you have not we may you do look a little green the ayi fretted her hand flitting nervously in her lap may throat had gone dry she had heard this story before recently when may felt everyone is eye turned toward her searing onto her skin their bloodshot pupil wet with pity wa she cry may reached a hand to wipe the corner of her eye but when she felt her cheek it wa oozing -- a halfstate between liquid and solid her finger came away with elastic red cheek meat she held up a shot glass looked at her reflection her skin wa melting off sloughing down her bone in ruddy drip she blinked she looked up at her family the pity in their face intensified what is happening may asked panic in her voice though some innate part of her knew it is almost time for you to go lao ye said we hope you had a good meal we did not want to tell you a shushu said you seemed so content an ayi said but you asked you should not have asked not now and not then when may asked the flesh of her eyelid started running in rivulet until there were no eyelid only the bulge of her naked eye in their socket may we know you remember think back how did you get here you can not remember can you you can not remember packing or sitting on the plane it wa spring break you were home and you asked fang

felt in the flaying pain before -- we will see you again next hungry ghost festival",
