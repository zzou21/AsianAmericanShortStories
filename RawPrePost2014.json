    "Accomplice": "IT her wasn anecdotals. t even Halloween The word, yet, with but all Ms. its expectations Hempel was already of intimacy thinking and speci- about her anecdotals. The word, with all its expectations of intimacy and speci- ficity, bothered her: a noun in the guise of an adjective, an obfuscation of the fact that twice a year she had to produce eighty-two of these ineluctable things. Not reports, like those written by other teachers at other schools, but anecdotals: loving and detailed accounts of a students progress, enlivened by descriptions of the child offering a piercing insight or aiding a struggling class- mate or challenging authority. It was a terrible responsibility: to render, in a recognizable way, something as ineffable as another human being, particularly a young one. On average she would spend an hour writing about each child, and then waste up to another hour rereading what she had just written, in the hopes that her words might suddenly reveal themselves as judicious. But too often Ms. Hempels anecdotals reminded her of those blurry portraits from photography's early days: is that a hand I see? A bird? The sitter has squirmed, readjusted her skirts, swatted at a fly: she is no longer a child, but a smudge of light. This is how Ms. Hempels students appeared, captured in her anecdotals: bright and beautiful and indistinct. The cubicle where she now sat, peeling an orange, would, in less than two months, become a Faculty Work Station. Other faculty members would sit in the work stations next to hers; they would peer over and say, \"Do not kill yourself. You re not writing a novel.\" But now there was only Mr. Polidori, humming faintly and balancing equations. The science and math teachers had it easy. During anecdotal season, Ms. Hempel would berate her younger, student self: she never should have turned away from the dark and gleaming surfaces of the lab. She had chosen instead the squishy embrace of the humanities, where nothing was quantifiable and absolute, and now she was paying for all th circles and talking about novels. Mrs. Beasl ment, had perfected an anecdotal formula: she indicated whether his ability to divide fraction matter of concern,\" and then ended with eithe whichever seemed more appropriate. The for an English teacher. Ms. Hempel could not co lary or plodding sentences without putting her own. Because there was always that skep believe that she could do all the things that sentence structure,\" \"incorporate metaphor if she were a fleshy coach who relaxes on panting around the gym. So the anecdotals must be beautiful. But she didn t want them to sound florid or excessive. She did not want to sound insincere. (Oh, superlatives! Ms. Hempels undoing.) She wanted to offer up tiny, exact, tender portraits of the children she taught, like those miniature paintings that Victorians would keep inside their lockets, along with a wisp of hair. And though she would fail to do so every time, she had not resigned herself to failure, could not experience that relief; every December and every May she would sit down to write, dogged by the fear that she would misrepresent a child, or that through some grievous grammatical error, some malapropism, some slip, she would expose herself and by her own hand reveal the hoax. \"If I started my anecdotals this afternoon, I would have to write only one and a half a day. That sounds manageable.\" \"Recycle,\" Mr. Polidori said, from the depths of his cubicle. \"I do recycle,\" Ms. Hempel said. \"I make my kids recycle, too.\" Mr. Polidori s face appeared above her. \"Use your anecdotals from last year. Just insert new names - if you go under Edit, then slide your arrow down to Replace, its quite straightforward.\" \"Oh,\" she said. \"I cannot do it. Because the material is all new this year. They are not reading A Light in the Forest anymore. Or April Morning. But it is a wonderful idea.\" This possibility had never occurred to her. For the new seventh grade curriculum, Ms. Hempel picked a book that had many swear words in it. She felt an attraction to swear words, just as she did to cable television, for both had been forbidden in her youth. Her father had considered swear words objectionable on the gr ness. \"Everyone uses the same old expletives o \"And you are not everyone.\" He grasped her cr squeezed, as if testing a cantaloupe at the farmers he declared. But to Ms. Hempel, swear words were beautiful precisely because they were ordinary, just as gum snapping and hair flipping were beautiful. She once longed to become a gum-snapping, foul-mouthed person, a person who could describe every single thing as fucking and not even realize she was doing it. In this, she never succeeded. When she read This Boys Life , when she saw shit and even fuck on the page, she quietly thrilled. Then she ordered copies for the seventh grade. \"First impressions?\" she asked, perched atop her desk, her legs swinging. \"What do you think?\" The seventh graders looked at each other uneasily. They had read the opening chapter for homework. A few stroked the books' covers, of which they had already declared their approval; it was sleek and muted. Grown-up. A cover that promised they were venturing into new territory: no more shiny titles, endorsements from the American Library Association, oil paintings of teenagers squinting uncertainly into the distance. \"Do you like it?\" Ms. Hempel tried again. She smiled entreatingly; her shoes banged against her desk. Teaching, she now understood, was a form of extortion; you were forever trying to extract from your students something they did not want to part with: their attention, their labor, their trust. David D'Souza, ladies man, came to her assistance. Even though he was a little chubby and overcurious about sex, he was a very popular boy in the seventh grade. He had gone out with a lot of girls. He walked down the hall- ways with the rolling, lopsided gait of the rappers that he so fervently admired. In the classroom, his poise deserted him; he sputtered a lot, rarely delivering coherent sentences. He batted away his ideas just as they were escaping from his mouth. But David was a gentleman, and ready to sacrifice his own dignity in order to rescue Ms. Hempels. Cooperative and responsive , she thought. Willing to take risks. \"Its like . . .\" he began, and stopped. Ms. Hempel smiled at him, nodding furiously, as if pumping the gas pedal on a car that would not start. \"Its . . .\" He grabbed his upper lip with his bottom teeth. He ground his palm into the desk. The other kids delicately averted thei ing the covers of their books. \"Its . . . differe school.\" The class exhaled: yes, it was different. Th quite trust it, particularly the boys, as if the cious about a book whose characters seemed to be a good kid, but could not stop getting lot, but was not above manipulating her into was all uncannily familiar. They were also his struggles: there was no sign that soon T in the wilderness, or traveling into the fut disaster. \"It does not really sound like a book,\" s child, aspiring trapeze artist, lover of Mar gifted. \"I normally do not like books,\" said Henry Woo, sad sack, hanger-on, misplacer of entire backpacks. Ms. Hempel would write, has difficulty concen- trating. \"Its okay for us to be reading this?\" said Simon Grosse, who needed to ask permission for everything. Ms. Hempel would write, conscientious. On Parents Night, Ms. Hempel felt fluttery and damp. She knew, from past experience, that she would make a burlesque of herself, that her every sentence would end with an exclamation point, and her hands would fly about wildly and despairingly, like two bats trapped inside a bedroom. The previous year, a boy named Zachary Bouchet had reported, \"My mother says that you smile too much.\" In the faculty room, Mr. Polidori threw an arm around her and whispered, \"Just pretend they are naked.\" That was the last thing Ms. Hempel wanted to imagine. Instead, she decided to picture her own parents sitting in front of her. She pictured her mother, who would make them late because she misplaced the car keys; and her father, who would station himself in the front row and ask embarrassing questions. Embarrassing not in their nature, but embarrassing simply because he had asked them. Her father liked to attract attention. \"Ni hao ma!\" he would greet the waiters at the Chinese restaurant. \"Yee-haw!\" he would whoop at the fourth grade square dance recital. \"Where is the defense?\" he would wail from the sidelines of soccer g sing out, the first to rise to his feet. Ms. Hempe standing ovations, all induced by her beaming Each of these parents, Ms. Hempel told her were. A mother began: \"This book they are re anyone else was troubled by the language.\" Ms. Hempel smiled bravely at the instigato up,\" she said, and reminded herself: this wom This woman is always running late.

Ms. Hempel doubted her speech. Perhaps an insurgency had bee concerned mother, who probably hijacked PT suggesting another bake sale. Maybe they he their own parents, or they believed on princ dirty. Maybe sitting in the plastic desk-chair felt like. One after another, the parents began describing their children: She talks about it at dinner. He takes it with him into the bathroom.

Three more giddy Ms. Hempel, standing at the front of t wanted to throw a kiss. She wanted to say And then it occurred to her: perhaps w her father had made someone else - a squ the seventh grade production of The Pirat The next morning, in homeroom, Ms. Hem from her crippling backpack. \"Your dad,\" presence.\" \"Benevolent?\" Cilia Matsui asked. Ms. Hempel always used big words when she spoke; they also appeared frequently in her anecdotals, words like acuity and perspicacious. It was all part of her ambitious schemes for vocabulary expansion. Most kids only took interest in new words if they felt they had something personal at stake. \"You re utterly depraved, Patrick,\" she would say. \"No, I will not. Look it up. There are about six of them sitting in the library.\" So Adelaides comments were astute. Gloria had an agile mind. Rashee\u010fs spelling was irreproachable. Even those who were not academically inclined deserved a dazzling adjective. David D'Souza, for instance, was chivalrous. These words, Ms. Hempel knew, were now permanently embedded. Even after the last layer of verbal detritus had settled, they would still be visible, winking brightly: yes, I was an iconoclastic thinker. Because one never forgets a compliment. \"You looked positively beatific during the exam,\" Miss Finnegan, her tenth grade English teacher, had told her. \"Staring out the window, a secret little smile on your face. I was worried, to tell the truth. But then you turned in the best of the bunch.\" Thus, beatific - blissful, saintly, serenely happy - was forever and irrevo- cably hers. She shared the new word with her father; she showed him the grade she had received. Aha, he said, with great vindication. Aha! Uncomplimentary words, however, seemed plimentary ones. That was not it, exactly. But wh would suddenly, unexpectedly, descend upon her, like a solitary cherry blossom, words of criticism able fixtures in the landscape: fire hydrants, cha sculptures. They were useful, though, as landm say to her father: Mr. Ziegler. White hair. He m when that failed, she would say: Do not you rem who called me lackadaisical. Her mothers memory was terrible, but her father could always be counted on. In his neat, reliable way, he sorted and shelved all the slights she had endured. Oh yes, he would say. Mr. Ziegler . Looking back on those conversations, she wondered if perhaps it was unfair to make him revisit the unhappy scene of her high school career. Remembering old criticisms is only fun once they have been proven laughably incorrect. Fractions! the famous mathematician hoots: Mrs. Beasley said I was hopeless at fractions! When her father died, a year ago that spring, Ms. Hempel had spoken at his memorial service, along with her brother and sister. Calvin talked about a day they went hiking together in Maine, and Maggie, before she started crying, remembered how he used to read aloud to her, every night before she went to bed. Ms. Hempels story sounded unsentimental by comparison. She described her father picking her up from play practice, when she was maybe fourteen or fifteen. It was winter, and too cold to wait for the bus. Before parking the car in the garage, he would deposit her at the backdoor, so that she would not have to walk through the slush. As she balanced her way up the path, he would flick his headlights on and off. The beams cast shadows across the lawn, making everything seem bigger than it really was: the randy cat, her mother s beloved gazebo, the fur sprouting from the hood of her parka. Right before she reached the door, she would turn around and wave at him. She could not see him, because the headlights were too bright, but she could hear him. Click, click. Click, click. Only after she stepped inside would he steer the car back out of the driveway. When Ms. Hempel finished speaking, she looked out at her family. They looked back at her expectantly, waiting to hear the end of the story. The last time she stood on this pulpit, many years before, she had received the same anxious look. She was the narrator for the Christmas pageant, and though she had spoken her part clearly and with dramatic flourish, she forgot to say her final line: \"So the three wise men followed the star of Bethlehem.\" A long pause followed, and then the three wise men stumble force had propelled them. For the rest of the pageant, she had to stay she was supposed to look down on the mang expression; instead, she watched the other ch else to make a mistake more terrible than her own. No one did. It could have happened to anyone, her mother would tell her, but she knew differently: it could have happened only to her. During her narration, she had fastened her eyes on the choir loft, but as she neared the end, in anticipation of the delicious relief that she would soon feel, she allowed her gaze to slip down onto the con- gregation below. There she saw her father, leaning forward very slightly, and holding onto the pew in front of him. He was smiling at her. Hugely. She lost her bearings entirely. Now, standing in the same pulpit, she looked out at her family as they waited hopefully for a final paragraph. She looked at them in defiance: That Is all! He clicked the headlights on and off. The End. And she wished something that she used to never wish: that her father was there, on the edge of his pew. He would have liked the story; it would have made sense to him. \"Is being benevolent a good thing or a bad thing?\" Cilia Matsui asked. \"A good thing!\" said Ms. Hempel. \"Benevolent means generous and kind.\" \"Oh yes,\" Cilia said. \"That sounds like my dad.\" Dwight, Toby s stepfather, was the character in the book that her kids despised most. They shuddered at the humiliations that he made Toby endure: shucking whole boxes full of foul-smelling horse chestnuts, attending Boy Scouts in a secondhand uniform, playing basketball in street shoes because he would not fork out the money for sneakers. They hated him for coming between Toby and his mother. They hated him for being petty and insecure and cruel. \"Dwight . . .\" they would mutter helplessly. \"I want to kill the guy.\" As Toby s situation worsened, they would turn over their books and study the author s photograph: his handsome, bushy mustache, his gentle eyes. \"He teaches at Syracuse,\" they would point out. \"He lives with his family in upstate New York.\" They loved these facts, because reading about the abusive stepdad, the failures at school, the yearnings to escape, to be someone else - it made them 3I feel terrible. \"He had such a tough life,\" they really tough life.\" But, according to the back of the book, To in the felicitous pairing of picture and blurb, became a writer!

I do not have enough to write about,\" Simon Grosse said. \"That Is not true!\" said Ms. Hempel. \"Each of you could write a book. Sev- eral books, in fact.\" She tried to remember what Flannery O'Connor had said on the subject. \"Anyone who is made it through childhood has enough material to last them until the day they die.\" \"We haven t made it through yet,\" Henry Woo said. \"But you will,\" said Ms. Hempel. \"And when you do, you will have lots to write about. Everyone does interesting things when they are kids.\" \"And bad things, like Toby?\" \"And bad things. Everyone has, even if everyone will not admit it.\" The kids waited for a moment, as if they needed, for politeness' sake, to make a show of digesting this information. \"Did you do bad things, Ms. Hempel?\" She should have expected it. \"Well. Be logical. Everyone includes me, does not it?\" Greedily, the kids leaned forward. \"What kinds of bad things?\" The back legs of desk-chairs rose into the air. Ms. Hempel heaved an enormous sigh of resignation. She let her arms drop heavily to her sides. \"You really want to know?\" she groaned, as if she were finally, under great duress, capitulating to their demands. \"You are really going to make me do this?\" In truth, she loved talking about herself. Especially to her students. All heads nodded vigorously. 33 \"I watched tv when I was not supposed to. And past my curfew.\" The back legs returned to the floor. \"That Is it? \"I wasn t always considerate of my parents.\" David D'Souza offered her a wan smile. \"And I pierced my nose with a sewing needle,\" Ms. Hempel said. \"My mother turned her face away every time I walked into the room, like she does when she s watching a violent movie. She was furious at me.\" \"Caroline Pratt pierced her bellybutton,\" Adelaide observed. Caroline was an eighth grader. \"She did not even use ice.\" Ms. Hempel shuffled through her collected misdeeds, trying to find ones that she could, in good conscience, share with seventh graders. \"I used to like skateboarders. I would help them dye their hair- it made my hands all blotchy. And I was always getting in trouble for breaking the dress code at my school. Once I wore - \" \"Ms. Hempel, did you always want to be a teacher?\" It startled her, the conversation veering off in this direction. But then it made sense to her: they believed they already knew the answer. Of course she always wanted to be a teacher. They were giving her a way out. A way of explaining her unremarkable youth. \"No!\" she said. \"I certainly did not.\" \"Why not?\" And the question sounded reproachful. \"You like teaching, don t you?\" Because suddenly there was the possibility that she didn t.\" You like being a teacher. And you were good at school.\" They said it with confidence. They treated it as a commonplace, an assumption that need not be challenged. But the fact that they had said it, the fact that the issue had arisen, in the midst of this tour through Ms. Hempels offenses, suggested that somewhere, in some part of themselves, they knew differently. It was astonishing, the efficiency with which they arrived at the truth. This was probably why children were so useful in stories and films about social injustice, like To Kill a Mockingbird. But Ms. Hempel did not think that this ability was particularly ennobling. It was just something they could do, the way dogs can hear certain high-pitched sounds, or the way X-rays can see past skin and tissue, down to the ghostly blueprint of the bones. Ms. Hempel sighed. A real one, this time. \"My school- it was demanding, academically. They had very high expec- tations of us.\" 34 \"So you were a really good student?\" \"No,\" Ms. Hempel said. \"I was not.\" And this, finally, impressed them. \"I did well on all the standardized tests high on those. Anything with bubbles I w Even short answer. But it was hard for me know, stick with an argument, weave differ \"And my school placed a lot of emphasis the final question on exams. Its not becaus because I didn t have any ideas. I had lots of were hard to make sense of. \"Has anyone ever told you that you have lots of potential? But that you aren t fulfilling it? That is what I heard all throughout high school. \"So I would get terribly nervous before a paper was due. I would tell myself, I am really going to fulfill my potential on this one. I am going to make an outline, do a rough draft, write a paragraph a night. I am going to plan my time effectively. And I would spend two weeks telling myself this, and there I would be, three of the clock in the morning, the paper s due in five hours, and I can t get my ideas to sit still long enough for me to write any of them down. \"That Is why,\" Ms. Hempel concluded, \"I make you turn in your outlines. And your rough drafts. Even though you hate me for it.\" But the attempt at levity went unremarked. Her class gazed at her, soberly. \"So how did you become a good student?\" Cilia Matsui asked. \"How did you get into a good college and become a teacher?\" \"I don t know,\" Ms. Hempel said. \"Worked harder, I guess. What do they say?- I buckled down.\" It wasn t until high school that all of this unfulfilled potential was dis- covered; up until then, she had been simply great: great kid, great student. A pleasure to have in class. But beginning in the ninth grade, she felt her great- ness gently ebbing away, retreating to a cool, deep cistern hidden somewhere inside her. I think its there! her teachers hollered down into the darkness. It is there! her father insisted. But where? she felt like asking. Because there was something faintly suspicious, faintly cajoling, about the way they spoke to her, as if she alone knew the location, and was refusing to tell them for the sake of being contrary. 35 Dear Parents , You recently have received an you anecdotal \" ab might not have been immediately apparent , this an child, from the perspective of one of his or her tea dents entreaties, I did not include a note of explana the exercise to you themselves , and I hope you h your children about the letters they wrote.

He was right on the other side. \"But I cannot promise you I will not.\" It was at that moment forgery first presented itself as an option. But instead she decided to ask, from then on, for her mother's signature. It seemed much easier than fraud. And she knew, anyhow, that even if she did try, she would inevitably get caught. Teachers were alert to that sort of crime. Ms. Hempel thought that parents would be, too. They were supposed to be vigilant. They were supposed to reprogram the cable box, listen to lyrics, sniff sweaters, check under the mattress. Or, at the least, distinguish between Ms. Hempel's prose and that of a seventh grader. She had read every one of the anecdotals herself, yet she could not account for the lapse. Some were panegyrics, plain and simple: Adelaide is without a doubt the most outstanding French student I have ever encountered in my years of teaching. Some were recantations: Please ignore my phone call of last week. Matthew is no longer disrupting my class.

He was small and impish and pale, and had assumed the role of a friendly, benign irritant, someone who pops up from behind desks and briskly waves. His greatest joy was a series of books about a religious community made up of mice, voles, and hedgehogs. They had taken the Benedictine vows, and created a devout but merry life for them- selves. Will frequently alluded to them. He produced a radio play in which he performed all the parts: the sonorous voice of the badger abbot, the tittering of the field mice, who were still novices and had to work in the monastery's kitchens. He pestered Ms. Hempel into borrowing a tape deck and making the whole class listen to his production. In anecdotal terms, he could be described as whimsical or inventive , or delightfully imaginative. Ms. Bean, however, was tall and gaunt and harried. When Ms. Hempel saw her, standing outside the schools gates, she was swaddled in bags: one for her computer, another for her dry cleaning, for her groceries, for Wills soccer uniform. It was strange, how clearly Ms. Hempel could picture her students' lives - Will had tae kwon do on Tuesday afternoons, and every Wednesday night he spent with his dad - and how murky comparison. All she could see in Ms. Bean was one. \"Do you have a moment,\" she said. Ms. Hempel said, of course. \"I wanted to speak with you about the assignment.\" Would she find it deceitful, and dishonest, as Mrs. Woo did? O like Mrs. Galvin, she had telephoned all the relatives, even the on fornia, to tell them the wonderful news. It was unlikely, though, that the assignment, thought it original and brilliant and bold. Only M seemed to feel that way. What Ms. Bean wanted her to know was that she felt the assignme unkind. Or maybe not unkind. Maybe just unfair. Because she had ing a long time for someone else to finally notice what she had alw about Will.

When they wer ting to prove everyone woefully mistaken. This was the story she wanted to tell. Then how did something altogether differen even recognize as her own. Even her father been changed into someone she did not quite know. A kind and shadowy figure, sitting in the car. Benevolent Thoughtful Considerate of others.",
    "Aftermath": "In Imamiya Park the boys are playing dodge ball, a new American game. Behind them tall poplars rise up through the low-lying dusk, intercepting the last of the sun\u2019s rays, which dazzle the leaves with white and gold. Makiko can hardly believe her son, Toshi, belongs with these older boys. Seven years old! Once, his growth had seemed commensurate with the passage of time. These last few years, however, with the war and sur- render, the changes have come too fast, skimming her consciousness like pebbles skipped over water. Makiko is grateful the war is over. But she cannot ignore a nagging sense that Japan\u2019s surrender has spawned a new threat\u2014one more subtle, more diffuse. She can barely articulate it, even to herself; feels unmoored, buf- feted among invisible forces surging all around her. As if caught up in these energies, her son\u2019s thin body is rapidly lengthening. Look! Within that cir- cle in the dirt he is dodging, he is feinting; his body twists with an unfamil- iar grace, foreshadowing that of a young man. Toshi\u2019s growth is abetted by a new lunch program at school that is sub- sidized by the American government, which has switched, with dizzying speed, from enemy to ally. Each day her son comes home with alien food in his stomach: bread, cheese, bottled milk. Last week, in the pocket of his shorts, Makiko found a cube of condensed peanut butter\u2014an American dessert, Toshi explained\u2014which he had meant to save for later. It was coated with lint from his pocket, which he brushed off, ignoring her plea to \u201cget rid of that dirty thing.\u201d And each day, Toshi comes home with questions she cannot answer: Who was Magellan? How do you say \u201cMy name is Toshi\u201d in English? How do you play baseball? Makiko shows him the ball games her own mother taught her. She bounces an imaginary ball, chanting a ditty passed down from the Edo p e r i o d : yellow topknots of the Portuguese wives spiraled like seashells and stuck atop their heads hold one up, to your ear shake it up and down a little shrunken brain is rattling inside In the old days, she tells him, they used to put something inside the rub- ber balls\u2014maybe a scrap of iron, she was not sure\u2014that made a rattling noise. Toshi, too old now for this sort of amusement, sighs with impa- t i e n c e . Just four years ago, Toshi\u2019s head had been too big for his body\u2014 endearingly out of proportion, like the head of a stuffed animal. Even then he had a manly, square-jawed face, not unlike that of a certain city-council candidate appearing on election posters at the time. Her husband, Yo s h i- tsune, nicknamed his son \u201cMr. Magistrate.\u201d Before going off to war, Yo s h i- tsune had developed a little routine with their son. \u201cOi, Toshi! Are you a man?\u201d Yoshitsune would prompt in his droll tone, using the word o t o k o , with its connotations of male bravery, strength, and honor. He would ask this question several times a day, often before neighbors and friends. \u201cH a i , F a t h er! I am a man!\u201d little Toshi would cry, stiffening at soldierly attention as he had been coached, trembling with eagerness to please. His short legs, splayed out from the knees as if buckling under the weight of his head, were still dimpled with baby fat. \u201cM a aa! An excellent, manly answer!\u201d the grownups praised, through peals of laughter. Makiko had laughed, too, a faint constriction in her throat, for Yo s h i- tsune had remarked to her, \u201cWhen I am out \ufb01ghting in the Paci\ufb01c, that is how I am going to remember him.\u201d After that, she began watching their child closely, trying to memorize what Yoshitsune was memorizing. Later, when her husband was gone, it comforted her to think that the same images swam in both their minds at night. Even today, Toshi\u2019s three-year- old \ufb01gure is vivid in her mind. On the other hand, she has not fully absorbed the war years, still shrinks from those memories and all that has f o l l o w e d . Foreigners, for instance, are now a familiar sight. American army jeeps with beefy red arms dangling out the windows roar down Kagane Boule- vard, the main thoroughfare just east of Toshi\u2019s school. \u201cKeep your young women indoors,\u201d the neighbors say. Occasionally, Makiko has seen a sol- dier offering chocolates or peanuts to little children, squatting down to their level, holding out the treat\u2014it seems to her they all have hairy arms \u2014as if to a timid cat. Just yesterday Toshi came home, smiling broadly and carrying chocolates\u2014not one square but three. Bile had surged up in Makiko\u2019s throat, and before she knew it, she had struck them right out of his hand and onto the kitchen \ufb02oor. \u201cHow could you?!\u201d she choked as Toshi, stunned, burst into sobs. \u201cHow could you?! Those men killed your f a t h er!\u201d This evening, Makiko has come to the park with a small box of cara- mels, bought on the black market with some of the money she was hoard- ing to buy winter yarn. \u201cIn the future,\u201d she will tell him, \u201cif you want some- thing so badly, you come to me. Ne? Not to them.\u201d On a bench in the toddlers\u2019 section, now deserted, she waits for her son to \ufb01nish his game with the other boys. All the other mothers have gone home to cook dinner. The playground equipment has not been maintained since the beginning of the war. The swing set is peeling with rust; the free- standing animals\u2014the ram, the pig, the rooster\u2014have broken-down springs, and their carnival paint has washed away, exposing more rusted s t e e l . Ara maaa! Her Toshi has \ufb01nally been hit! Makiko feels a mother\u2019s pang. He is crossing the line to the other side now, carrying the ball. Makiko notes the ease with which the fallen one seems to switch roles in this game, heaving the ball at his former teammates without the slightest trace of dis- l o y a l t y . This year, Makiko is allowing Toshi to light the incense each evening before the family altar. He seems to enjoy prayer time much more now that he can use matches. She also regularly changes which photograph of her husband is displayed beside the miniature gong. This month\u2019s photo- graph shows Yoshitsune in a cotton y you k a t a , smoking under the ginkgo tree in the garden. Sometimes, in place of a photograph, she displays an old letter or one of his silk scent bags, still fragrant after a bit of massaging. To keep Toshi interested, Makiko presents his father in the light of con- stant renewal. \u201cJust talk to him inside your mind,\u201d she tells her son. \u201cHe wants to know what you are learning in school, what games you are playing. Just like any other father, n e ? Do not leave him behind, do not ignore him, just because he is dead.\u201d She wonders if Toshi secretly considers his father a b you r d e n, making demands from the altar, like a cripple from a wheelchair. \u201cYour father\u2019s very handsome in this picture, ne?\u201d she says tonight. Within the lacquered frame, her son\u2019s father glances up from lighting a cig- arette, a bemused half smile on his face, as if he is waiting to make a wry c o m m e n t . Toshi nods absently. Frowning, he slashes at the matchbox with the expert \ufb02ourish of a second-grade boy. The match rips into \ufb02ames. \u201cAnswer properly! You are not a little baby anymore.\u201d \u201cH a i , Mother.\u201d Toshi sighs with a weary, accommodating air, squaring 96 his shoulders in a semblance of respectful attention. Makiko remembers with sorrow the big head, the splayed legs of her baby boy. It amazes her that Toshi has no memory of the routine he once per- formed with his father. \u201cWhat d o you remember of him?\u201d she prods every so often, hoping to dislodge some new memory. But all that Toshi remem- bers of his father is being carried on one arm before a sunny window. \u201cMaaa, what a wonderful memory!\u201d Makiko encourages him each time. \u201cIt must have been a very happy moment! \u201d When would this have taken place: which year, which month? Wo you l d even Yoshitsune have remembered it, this throwaway moment that, inex- plicably, has outlasted all the others in their son\u2019s mind? She tries conjur- ing it up, as if the memory is her own. For some reason she imagines a you t you m n, the season Yoshitsune sailed away: October 1 9 42. How the after- noon sun would seep in through the nursery window, golden, almost amber, advancing with the viscous quality of Hiezan honey or of nostalgia, overtaking sluggish dust motes and even sound. She wishes Toshi could remember the old view from that upstairs window: a sea of gray tiled roofs drowsing in the autumn haze, as yet unravaged by the \ufb01res of war. \u201cI am done,\u201d Toshi says. \u201cWhat! Already? Are you sure? \u201d \u201cH ai, Mother.\u201d Already heading for the dining room, where supper lies waiting on the low table, he slides back the s h o j i door in such a hurry that it grates on the grooves. Makiko considers calling him back\u2014his prayers are getting shorter and shorter\u2014but the incident with the chocolates is still too recent for another reprimand. She follows him into the dining room. \u201cA man who forgets his past,\u201d she quotes as she scoops rice into his bowl, \u201cstays at the level of an animal.\u201d Toshi meets her eyes with a guilty, resentful glance. \u201cGo on,\u201d she says blandly, \u201ceat it while it is hot.\u201d Toshi falls to. In order to supplement their meager rice ration, Makiko continues to mix in chopped kabura radishes\u2014which at least resemble rice in color\u2014as she did during the war. Sometimes she switches to chopped turnips. At \ufb01rst, before the rationing became strict, Toshi would hunch over his rice bowl with his chopsticks, fastidiously picking out one bit of vegetable after another and discarding it on another plate. Now, he eats with gusto. It cuts her, the things he has grown used to. As a grown man he will reminisce over all the wrong things, things that should never have been a part of his childhood: this shameful pauper food; a block of peanut paste covered with lint; enemy soldiers amusing themselves by tossing chocolate and peanuts to children. Later, Toshi ventures a question. Makiko has noticed that nighttime\u2014 the black emptiness outside, the hovering silence\u2014still cows him a little, stripping him of his daytime cockiness. After his goodnight bow, Toshi remains kneeling on the t a t a m i \ufb02oor. He says, \u201cI was thinking, Mama,about how I am seven\u2014and how I only remember things that happened after I was three. So that means I have forgotten a whole half of my life\u2014 r i g h t?\u201d \u201cThat is right,\u201d Makiko says. He is looking up at her, his brows puckered in a look of doleful concentration, which reminds her of his younger days. \u201cBut it is perfectly normal, Toshi-kun. It is to be expected.\u201d He is still thinking. \u201cSo when I get older,\u201d he says, \u201cam I going to keep on forgetting? Am I going to forget you, too? \u201d Makiko reaches out and strokes his prickly crewcut. \u201cFrom this age on, \u201d she says, \u201cyou will remember everything, Toshi-kun. Nothing more will ever be lost.\u201d In the middle of the night, Makiko awakens from a dream in which Yoshitsune is hitting her with a \ufb02y swatter. She lies paralyzed under her futon, outrage buzzing in her chest. Details from the dream wash back into her mind: Yoshitsune\u2019s smile, distant and amused; the insolent way he wielded the swatter, as if she were hardly worth the effort. A blue sheet of moonlight, slipping in through the space between two sliding panels, glows in the dark. In the \ufb01rst year or two after his death, this sort of thing would happen o f t e n, and not always in the form of dreams. There were times\u2014but hardly ever anymore; why tonight?\u2014when, in the middle of washing the dishes or sweeping the alley, some small injustice from her past, long forgotten, would rise up in her mind, blocking out all else till her heart beat hard and fast. Like that time, scarcely a month after their wedding, when Yo s h i t s you n e had run into his old girlfriend at Nanjin Station and made such a fuss: his absurd, rapt gaze; the intimate timbre of his voice as he inquired after her w e l f a r e . And there was the time\u2014the only time in their entire marriage\u2014when Yoshitsune had grabbed Makiko by the shoulders and shaken her hard. He would let go immediately, but not before she had felt the anger in his power- ful hands and her throat had choked up with fear. That, too, was early on in the marriage, before Makiko learned to tolerate his sending sizable sums of money to his mother each month. What is to be done with such memories? They get scattered, left behind. Over the past few years, more pleasant recollections have taken the lead, informing all the rest, like a \ufb02ock of birds, heading as one body along an altered course of nostalgia. She has tried so hard to remain true to the past. But the weight of her need must have been too great: her need to be comforted, her need to pro- vide a legacy for a small, fatherless boy. Tonight she senses how far beneath the surface her own past has sunk, its outline distorted by deceptively clear w a t e r s . 98 Toshi has been counting the days till Tanabata Day. A small festival is being held at the riverbank\u2014the \ufb01rst since the war. It will be a meager affair, of course, nothing like it used to be: no gold\ufb01sh scooping, no soba noodles, no fancy \ufb01reworks. However, according to the housewives at the open-air market, there will be a limited number of sparklers\u2014the nicest kind, Makiko tells her son\u2014and traditional corn grilled with shoyu, which can be purchased out of each family\u2019s food allowance. Because of an after-dark incident near Kubota Temple involving an American soldier and a young girl, Makiko\u2019s younger brother has come by this evening to accompany them to the festival. Noboru is a second-year student at the local university. \u201cN e , Big Sister! Are you ready yet?\u201d he keeps calling from the living room. Makiko is inspecting Toshi\u2019s nails and the back of his collar. \u201cBig Sister,\u201d Noboru says, looking up as Makiko \ufb01nally appears in the doorway, \u201cyour house is too immaculate. I get nervous every time I come here!\u201d He is sitting stif\ufb02y on a \ufb02oor cushion, sipping homemade persim- mon tea. \u201cWell,\u201d Makiko answers, \u201cI hate dirt.\u201d She has switched, like most w o m e n, to Western dresses\u2014they require less fabric\u2014but it makes her irritable, having to expose her bare calves in public. She tugs down her knee-length dress. \u201cA aa,\u201d says young Noboru from his \ufb02oor cushion, \u201cbut I, for one, am fascinated by it. The idea of it, I mean. What is that old saying\u2014\u2018Nothing grows in a sterile pond\u2019? Just think, Big Sister, of the things that come out of dirty water. A lotus, for example. Or a pearl. Just think: a pearl\u2019s nothing more than a grain of dirt covered up by an oyster! And life itself, Big Sister, billions of years ago\u2014emerging from the primordial muck! \u201d \u201cMaa maa, N o b o -k you n.\u201d She sighs, double-checking her handbag for coin purse, ration tickets, and handkerchief. \u201cYou seem to be learning some very interesting concepts at the university.\u201d Toshi is waiting by the front door in shorts and a collared shirt, impa- tiently pulling the door open and then shut, open and then shut. Finally, they are on their way, strolling down the narrow alley in the still, muggy evening. The setting sun angles down on the east side of the alley, casting a pink and orange glow on the charred wooden lattices, where shadows stretch, like the long heads of snails, from the slightest of protru- sions. In the shadowed side of the alley, one of the bucktoothed Kimura daughters ladles water from a bucket onto the asphalt around her door, pausing, with a good-evening bow, to let them pass. The water, colliding with warm asphalt, has released a smell of many layers: asphalt, earth, scorched wood, tangy dragon\u2019s beard moss over a mellower base of tree foliage; prayer incense and t a t a m i straw, coming from the Kimuras\u2019 half- open door; and mixed in with it all, some scent far back from Makiko\u2019s own childhood that falls just short of de\ufb01nition. 99 \u201c We Japanese,\u201d Noboru is saying, \u201cmust reinvent ourselves. We must change to \ufb01t the modern world. We must not remain an occupied nation.\u201d He talks of the new constitution, of the new trade agreements. Makiko has little knowledge of politics. She is amused\u2014disquieted, too\u2014by this acad- emic young man, who before the war was a mere boy loping past her win- dow with a butter\ufb02y net over his shoulder. \u201cFundamental shifts . . . ,\u201d Noboru is saying, \u201c. . . outdated pyramidal structures.\u201d He has just begun wearing hair pomade with an acrid metallic scent. It seems to suggest fervor, fundamental shifts. \u201cT o s h i -k un!\u201d Makiko calls. \u201cDo not go too far.\u201d The boy stops running. He walks, taking each new step in exaggerated slow motion. \u201cSo much change!\u201d she says to Noboru as she tugs at her cotton dress. \u201cAnd so fast. Other countries had centuries to do it in.\u201d \u201cS\u00f6, s\u00f6, Big Sister!\u201d Noboru says. \u201cS\u00f6, s\u00f6. But we have no choice\u2014 t h a t \u2019 s a fact. You jettison from a sinking ship if you want to survive.\u201d The pair approach Mr. Watanabe watering his potted morning glories in the twilight. Holding his watering can in one hand, the old man gives them a genteel bow over his cane. \u201cYo s h i t s you n e -s a n ,\u201d he murmurs politely, \u201c M a k i k o -s a n.\u201d He then turns back to his morning glories, bending over them with the tenderness of a mother with a newborn. \u201cPoor Wa t a n a b e -san, ne?\u201d Noboru whispers. \u201cHe gets more and more confused every time we see him.\u201d Yes, poor Mr. Watanabe, Makiko thinks. Bit by bit he is being pulled back in, like a slowing planet, toward some core, some necessary center of his past. Laden with memory, his mind will never catch up to Noboru\u2019s new constitution or those trade agreements, or even the implications of that billboard with English characters\u2014instructions for arriving soldiers? \u2014rising above the blackened rooftops and blocking his view of the Hiezan h i l l s . Oddly, Mr. Watanabe\u2019s greeting has triggered a memory from the past: Makiko is strolling with Yoshitsune on a summer evening. For one heart- beat she experiences exactly how things used to be\u2014their commonplace existence, before later events imposed their nostalgia\u2014with a stab of phys- ical recognition that is inde\ufb01nable, impossible to call up again. Then it is gone, like the gleam of a \ufb01sh, having stirred up all the around her. They walk on in silence. \u201cT o s h i -k un!\u201d she calls out again. \u201cSlow down.\u201d Toshi pauses, waiting for them; he swings at the air with an imaginary bat. \u201cStriku! Striku!\u201d he hisses. It occurs to Makiko how arti\ufb01cial this war has been, suspending people in the same, unsustainable state of solidarity. For a while, everyone had clung together in the bomb shelter off Nijiya Street, thinking the same thoughts, breathing in the same damp earth and the same warm, uneasy currents made by bodies at close range. But that is over now. Makiko thinks of her future. She is still full of life and momentum. There 100 is no doubt that she will pass through this period and into whatever lies beyond it, but at a gradually slowing pace; a part of her, she knows, will lag behind in the honeyed light of pre-war years. \u201c T o s h i -k you n!\u201d she cries. \u201cWa i t!\u201d Her son is racing ahead, his long shadow sweeping the sun-lit fence as sparrows \ufb02utter up from charred pal- i n g s . Makiko stands out on the veranda, fanning herself with a paper you c h i w a . Toshi is already asleep. The night garden is muggy; the mosquitoes are out in full force. She can hear their ominous whine from the hydrangea bush, in between the rasping of crickets, but they no longer target her as they did in her youth. She is thinner now, her skin harder from the sun, her blood watered down from all the rationing. It was a wonderful festival. Shadowy adults bent over their children, helping them to hold sparklers over the glassy water. The sparklers sput- tered softly in the dark, shedding white \ufb02akes of light. Makiko had watched from a distance; Toshi was old enough, he had insisted, to do it by himself. She had remarked to Noboru how there is something in everyone that responds to \ufb01reworks: so \ufb02eeting, so lovely in the dark. It was a \ufb01ne night for Toshi. \u201cThis corn is so good, ne, Mama?\u201d he kept saying, looking up from his rationed four centimeters of corncob. \u201cThis sure tastes good, ne?\u201d The joy on his face, caught in the glow of red paper lanterns, brought a lump to her throat. Tonight there is a full moon. Earlier, at dusk, it was opaque and insub- stantial. Now, through shifting moisture in the air, it glows bright and strong, awash with light. For Makiko, the festival owed its luster to all that lay beneath, to all those other evenings of her life and their lingering phosphorescence. Which long-ago evenings exactly? They are slowly losing shape, merging together in her consciousness. Perhaps Toshi will remember this night. Perhaps it will rise up again once he is grown. Some smell, some glint of light will bring texture and emotion to a future summer evening. As will his memory of praying before his father\u2019s picture or being carried by his father before an open window.",
    "AManLikeHim": "The girl, unlike most people photographed for fashion magazines, was not beautiful. Moreover, she had no desire to appear beautiful, as anyone looking at her could tell, and for that reason Teacher Fei stopped turning the pages and studied her. She had short, unruly hair and wide-set eyes that glared at the camera in a closeup shot. In another photo, she stood in front of a bedroom door, her back to the camera, her hand pushing the door ajar. A bed and its pink sheet were artfully blurred. Her black T-shirt, in sharp focus, displayed a line of white printed characters: \u201cMy father is less of a creature than a pig or a dog because he is an adulterer.\u201d The girl was nineteen, Teacher Fei learned from the article. Her parents had divorced three years earlier, and she suspected that another woman, a second cousin of her father\u2019s, had seduced him. On her eighteenth birthday, the first day permitted by law, the daughter had filed a lawsuit against him. As she explained to the reporter, he was a member of the Communist Party, and he should be punished for abandoning his family, and for the immoral act of taking a mistress in the first place. When the effort to imprison her father failed, the girl started a blog and called it A Declaration of War on Unfaithful Husbands. \u201cWhat is it that this crazy girl wants?\u201d Teacher Fei asked out loud before reaching the girl\u2019s answer. She wanted her father to lose his job, she told the reporter, along with his social status, his freedom, if possible, and his mistress for sure; she wanted him to beg her and her mother to take him back. She would support him for the rest of his life as the most filial daughter, but he had to repent\u2014and, before that, to suffer as much as she and her mother had. What malice, Teacher Fei thought. He flung the magazine across the room, knocking a picture frame from the bookcase and surprising himself with this sudden burst of anger. At sixty-six, Teacher Fei had seen enough of the world to consider himself beyond the trap of pointless emotions. Was it the milkman, his mother asked from the living room. Milkmen had long ago ceased to exist in Beijing, milk being sold abundantly in stores now; still, approaching ninety, she was snatched from time to time by the old fear that a neighbor or a passerby would swipe their two rationed bottles. Remember how they had twice been fined for lost bottles, she asked as Teacher Fei entered the living room, where she sat in the old armchair that had been his father\u2019s favorite spot in his last years. Teacher Fei had not listened closely, but it was a question he knew by heart, and he said yes, he had remembered to pick up the bottles the moment they were delivered. Be sure to leave them in a basin of cold water so the milk does not turn sour, she urged. He stood before her and patted her hands, folded in her lap, and reassured her that there was no need for her to worry. She grabbed him then, curling her thin fingers around his. \u201cI have nothing to say about this world,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI know,\u201d Teacher Fei said. He bent down and placed her hands back in her lap. \u201cShould I warm some milk?\u201d he asked, though he could see that already she was slipping away into her usual reverie, one that would momentarily wash her mind clean. Sometimes he made an effort, coaxing her to walk with baby steps to exercise her shrinking muscles. A few years ago, the limit of her world had been the park two blocks down the street, and later the stone bench across the street from their apartment; now it was their fifth-floor balcony. Teacher Fei knew that in time he would let his mother die in peace in this apartment. She disliked strangers, and he could not imagine her in a cold bed in a crowded hospital ward. Teacher Fei withdrew to the study, which had been his father\u2019s domain until his death. His mother had long ago stopped visiting this room, so Teacher Fei was the one who took care of the books on the shelves, airing the yellowing pages twice a year on the balcony, but inevitably some of the books had become too old to rescue, making way for the fashion magazines that Teacher Fei now purchased. The black-clad girl taunted him from the magazine lying open on the floor. He picked her up and carefully set her on the desk, then fumbled in the drawer for an inkpot. Much of the ink in the bottle had evaporated from lack of use, and few of the brushes in the bamboo container were in good shape now. Still, with a fine brush pen and just enough ink on the tip, he was able to sketch a scorpion in the margin of the page, its pincers stabbing toward the girl\u2019s eyes. It had been six years since he retired as an art teacher, nearly forty since he last painted out of free will. Teacher Fei looked at the drawing. His hand was far from a shaking old man\u2019s. He could have made the scorpion an arthropod version of the girl, but such an act would have been beneath his standards. Teacher Fei had never cursed at a woman, either in words or in any other form of expression, and he certainly did not want to begin with a young girl. Later, when Mrs. Luo, a neighbor in her late forties who had been laid off by the local electronics factory, came to sit with Teacher Fei\u2019s mother, he went to a nearby Internet caf\u00e9. It was a little after two, a slow time for the business, and the manager was dozing off in the warm sunshine. A few middle-school students, not much older than twelve or thirteen, were gathered around a computer, talking in tones of hushed excitement, periodically breaking into giggles. Teacher Fei knew these types of kids. They pooled their pocket money in order to spend a few truant hours in a chat room, impersonating people much older than themselves and carrying on affairs with other human beings who could be equally fraudulent. In his school days, Teacher Fei had skipped his share of classes to frolic with friends in the spring meadow or to take long walks in the autumn woods, and he wondered if, in fifty years, the children around the computer would have to base their nostalgia on a fabricated world that existed only in a machine. But who could blame them for paying little attention to the beautiful April afternoon? Teacher Fei had originally hired Mrs. Luo for an hour a day so that he could take a walk; ever since he had discovered the Internet, Mrs. Luo\u2019s hours had been increased. Most days now she spent three hours in the afternoon taking care of Teacher Fei\u2019s mother and cooking a meal for both of them. The manager of the Internet caf\u00e9 had once suggested that Teacher Fei purchase a computer of his own; the man had also volunteered to set it up, saying that he would be happy to see a good customer save money, even if it meant that he would lose some business. Teacher Fei had rejected the generous offer\u2014despite his mother\u2019s increasing loss of her grip on reality, he could not bring himself to perform any act of dishonesty in her presence. Teacher Fei located the girl\u2019s blog without a problem. There were more pictures of her there, some with her mother. Anyone could see the older woman\u2019s unease in front of the camera. In her prime she would have been more attractive than her daughter was now, but perhaps it was the diffidence in her face that had softened some of the features that in her daughter\u2019s case were accentuated by rage. Under the heading \u201cHappier Time,\u201d Teacher Fei found a black-and-white photo of the family. The girl, aged three or four, sat on a high stool, and her parents stood on either side. On the wall behind them was a garden, painted by someone without much artistic taste, Teacher Fei could tell right away. The girl laughed with a mouthful of teeth, and the mother smiled demurely, as a married woman would be expected to in front of a photographer. The father was handsome, with perfectly shaped cheekbones and deep-set eyes not often found in a Chinese face, but the strain in his smile and the tiredness in those eyes seemed to indicate little of the happiness the daughter believed had existed in her parents\u2019 marriage. Teacher Fei shook his head and scribbled on a scrap of paper the man\u2019s name and address and home phone number, as well as the address and number of his work unit, which had all been listed by the girl. A scanned image of his resident\u2019s I.D. was displayed, too. Teacher Fei calculated the man\u2019s age, forty-six, and noted that on the paper. When he went to the message board on the girl\u2019s Web site, Teacher Fei read a few of the most recent posts, left by sympathetic women claiming to have been similarly hurt by unfaithful husbands or absent fathers. \u201cDearest Child,\u201d one message started, from a woman calling herself \u201cAnother Betrayed Wife,\u201d who praised the young girl as an angel of justice and courage. Teacher Fei imagined these women dialling the father\u2019s number at night, or showing up in front of his work unit to brandish cardboard signs covered with words of condemnation. \u201cTo all who support this young woman\u2019s mission,\u201d he typed in the box at the bottom of the Web page, \u201cthe world will be a better place when one learns to see through to the truth instead of making hasty and unfounded accusations.\u201d \u201cA Concerned Man,\u201d Teacher Fei signed his message. A different opinion was not what these women would want to hear, but any man with a brain had to accept his responsibility to make the truth known. A girl among the group of middle schoolers glanced at Teacher Fei and then whispered to a companion, who looked up at him with a snicker before letting herself be absorbed again by the screen. An old man with wrinkles and without hair. Teacher Fei assessed himself through the girls\u2019 eyes: bored and boring, no doubt undesirable in any sense, but who could guarantee the girls that the flirtatious young man online who made their hearts speed was not being impersonated by an equally disgraceful old man? Later that evening, when Teacher Fei had wrung a warm towel to the perfect stage of moistness and passed it to his mother, who sat on another towel on her bed, a curtain separating her partly undressed body from him, he thought about the two girls and their youthful indifference. One day, if they were fortunate enough to survive all the disappointments life had in store for them, they would have to settle into their no longer young bodies. \u201cDo you remember Carpenter Chang?\u201d Teacher Fei\u2019s mother asked from the other side of the curtain. Three times a week, Mrs. Luo bathed Teacher Fei\u2019s mother, and on the other evenings Teacher Fei and his mother had to make do with the curtain as he assisted her with her sponge bath and listened to her reminisce about men and women long dead. Half an hour, and sometimes an hour, would pass, his mother washing and talking on one side of the curtain, him listening and sometimes pressing for details on the other side. This was the time of day they talked the most, when Teacher Fei knew that although his mother\u2019s body was frail and her mind tangled by memories, she was still the same graceful woman who, with her unhurried storytelling, knew how to take the awkwardness out of a situation in which she had to be cared for by a grown son who had remained a bachelor all his life. Having his mother as his only companion in old age was not how Teacher Fei had envisioned his life, but he had accepted this with little grievance. He enjoyed conversations with her, for whom things long forgotten by the world were as present as the air she shallowly breathed: two apprentices pulling a giant paper fan back and forth in a barbershop to refresh the sweating customers, the younger one winking at her while her grandfather snored on the bench waiting for his daily shave; the machine her father had installed in the front hall of their house, operated by a pedalling servant, which cut a long tube of warm, soft toffee into small neat cubes that, once hardened, were wrapped in squares of cellophane by her and her four sisters; the cousins and second cousins who had once been playmates, fed and clothed and schooled alongside her and her sisters when they were young, but who later claimed to have been exploited as child laborers by her capitalist father; her wedding to Teacher Fei\u2019s father, attended by the best-known scholars of the day and lamented by most of her relatives, her mother included, as a bad match. Teacher Fei\u2019s father had been the oldest and poorest of his mother\u2019s suitors. Twenty years her senior, he had worked as a part-time teacher in the \u00e9lite high school that she and her sisters attended, and when she rejected him a renowned scholar wrote to her on his behalf, assuring the sixteen-year-old girl of what was beyond her understanding at the time: that Teacher Fei\u2019s father would become one of the most important philosophers in the nation and, more than that, would be a devoted husband who would love her till death parted them. Teacher Fei had always suspected that his mother had agreed to see his father only to appease the scholar, but within a year the two had married, and afterward, before Teacher Fei\u2019s father found a university position, his mother used her dowry to help her husband support his parents and siblings in the countryside. Unable to become pregnant, she had adopted a boy\u2014Teacher Fei\u2014from the long line of nephews and nieces who lived in close quarters in her husband\u2019s family compound, which had been built and rebuilt in the course of four generations. She had never hidden this fact from Teacher Fei, and he remembered being saddened after a holiday in his father\u2019s home village when he was eight and finally understood that he alone had been plucked from his siblings and cousins. His relatives, his birth parents included, had treated him with respect and even awe. It was his good fortune, his mother had said, comforting him, to have two pairs of parents and two worlds. Poor man, she said now, and for a moment, lost in his reverie, Teacher Fei wondered if he had told her about the avenging daughter. Then he realized that his mother was still talking about the carpenter, who had once carved five coffins for his children, all killed by typhoid within a week. The carpenter\u2019s wife, who had been hired as a wet nurse for Teacher Fei when he first left his birth mother, had returned to the house years later with the news. Even as a ten-year-old, Teacher Fei could see that the woman had been driven out of her mind and would go on telling the story to any willing ears until her death. It is the innocent ones who are often preyed upon by life\u2019s cruelty, Teacher Fei replied, and when his mother did not speak he recounted the girl\u2019s story from the magazine. He paused when his mother, dressed in her pajamas, pulled the curtain aside. All set for the dreamland, she said. He did not know if she had heard him, but when he tucked her in she looked up from the pillow. \u201cYou should not feel upset by the girl,\u201d she said. He was not, Teacher Fei replied; it was just that he found the girl\u2019s hatred extraordinary. His mother shook her head slightly on the pillow, looking past his face at the ceiling, as if she did not want to embarrass him by confronting his lie. \u201cThe weak-minded choose to hate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the least painful thing to do, is not it?\u201d She closed her eyes as if exhausted. Rarely did she stay in a conversation with him with such clarity these days, and he wondered whether she had chosen to neglect the world simply because it no longer interested her. He waited, and when she did not open her eyes he wished her a night of good sleep and clicked off the bedside lamp. \u201cThe weak-minded choose to hate,\u201d Teacher Fei wrote in his journal later that night. For years, he would had the habit of taking notes of his mother\u2019s words. \u201cI have nothing to say about this world,\u201d he wrote, the line most often repeated in the journal. Twenty-five years ago, his father, after a long day of musing in his armchair, had said the same thing, his final verdict before he swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Teacher Fei\u2019s mother had not sounded out of sorts when she had called him that evening to report his father\u2019s words, nor had she cried the following morning on the phone with the news of his father\u2019s death. Teacher Fei suspected that, if his mother had not been an active accomplice, she had, at the least, been informed of the suicide plan; either way it made no difference, for the border between husband and wife had long been obscured in his parents\u2019 marriage. What surprised Teacher Fei was his mother\u2019s willingness to live on. He visited her daily after his father\u2019s death and within a year had moved in with her. He recorded and analyzed every meaningful sentence of hers, looking for hints that the words were her farewell to the world. He was intentionally careless about his pills, and hers, too, as he believed she must have been in his father\u2019s final days\u2014they had always been a family of insomniacs\u2014but by the fifth anniversary of his father\u2019s death Teacher Fei had stopped waiting. She had nothing to say about the world, she told him that day, more out of amusement than resignation, and he knew then that she would not choose to end her life. The message that Teacher Fei had left on the girl\u2019s Web site was not there when he checked the next day at the Internet caf\u00e9. Why was he surprised? Still, his hands shook as he composed another message, calling the girl a manipulative liar. A young couple, seventeen or eighteen at most, cast disapproving glances at Teacher Fei from another computer, seemingly alarmed by his vehement treatment of the keyboard. Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop The chat rooms he normally frequented held little attraction for him today. He was leaving on a business trip abroad, he told a friend in one chat room who called herself Perfume Beauty, and then repeated the news to similarly named women in other chat rooms, knowing that they would find other idling men to flirt with. The night before, he had imagined the reaction of the girl and her female allies to his message, and had composed an eloquent retort to throw at these petty-minded women. But no doubt the girl would again erase it, and he could not stop her, nor could he expose her dishonesty. Teacher Fei logged off the computer and watched the boy sneak a hand under the girl\u2019s sweater and wiggle it around, perhaps trying to unhook her troublesome bra. She looked at the screen with a straight face, but her body, moving slightly in co\u00f6peration, betrayed her enjoyment. The girl noticed Teacher Fei\u2019s attention first and signalled to her boyfriend to stop. Without withdrawing his hand, he mouthed a threat at Teacher Fei, who lifted his arms as if surrendering and stood up to leave. When he walked past the couple, he raised a thumb and gave the boy a smile, as if they were conspiring comrades; the boy, caught off guard, grinned disarmingly before turning his face away. Teacher Fei had never cupped his hands around a woman\u2019s breasts, and for an instant he wished that he possessed the magic to make the boy disappear and let him take his place next to the girl. What stupidity, Teacher Fei chided himself, after he had gulped down a can of ice-cold soda water at a roadside stand. It was that angry girl and her fraudulence\u2014that was what was depriving him of his peace. He wished that he had been his mother\u2019s birth son, that he had her noble and calm blood running through his veins, guarding him against the ugliness of the world. The good fortune that his mother had once assured him of had not lasted long. At eighteen, he had been an ambitious art student about to enter the nation\u2019s top art institute, but within a year his father, an exemplary member of the reactionary intellectuals, was demoted from professor to toilet cleaner, and Teacher Fei\u2019s education had been terminated. For the next twenty years, Teacher Fei\u2019s mother had accompanied his father from building to building, one hand carrying a bucket of cleaning tools and the other holding her husband\u2019s arm, as if they were on their way to a banquet. Yet, in the end, even she could not save her husband from despair. Teacher Fei\u2019s father had killed himself two years after he was restored to his position at the university. The next day, Teacher Fei saw that his second message to the girl had also been confiscated by the cyberworld. A different message, left by a woman who hailed the girl as a guardian of the morality of modern China, taunted Teacher Fei in bold type. He hastily composed another post, and then spent twenty minutes rephrasing it in a calmer tone, but a day later, when that message had also been deleted, his rage erupted. He called her a \u201cscorpion girl\u201d in a new message, saying that he hoped no man would make the mistake of his life by marrying her and succumbing to her poison; he took great pity on her father, since an evil daughter like her would make any father live in a hell. Her father . . . Teacher Fei paused in his typing, as the man\u2019s unhappy face in the photo came back to him. He decided to call the man\u2019s work unit, an institute affiliated with the Ministry of Propaganda, from a phone booth in the street. A woman answered, and when Teacher Fei asked for the man by name she inquired about the nature of his business. An old school friend who has lost touch, he said, apologizing that he did not have another number for him and so had to make the initial contact through the work unit. The woman hesitated and then told him to wait. When the phone was picked up again, Teacher Fei was surprised by the voice, which sounded as though it belonged to a much older man. It did not matter what his name was, Teacher Fei replied when the girl\u2019s father asked for it; he was merely calling as a man who was sympathetic to a fellow-man\u2019s situation. He then asked if there was a chance that they could meet in person. The line clicked dead while he was in midsentence. When Mrs. Luo came the next day, Teacher Fei begged her to stay till later in the evening. He would pay her double for the extra hours, he said, and Mrs. Luo, after complaining about the inconvenience, agreed, adding that a man like Teacher Fei indeed deserved an occasional break from caring for an elderly woman. Mrs. Luo had not lowered her voice, and Teacher Fei glanced at his mother, who sat in the armchair with her eyes fixed on a square of afternoon sunshine on the floor. She was obedient and quiet in front of Mrs. Luo, who, like everybody else, believed that Teacher Fei\u2019s mother had long been lost in her own world of dementia. A man like him. In the street, Teacher Fei pondered Mrs. Luo\u2019s words. What did that mean\u2014a man like him\u2014a bachelor without a son to carry on his blood, a retired art teacher whose name most of his students had forgotten the moment they graduated from elementary school, a disgraceful old man who purchased fashion magazines at the newsstand and wasted his afternoons alongside teenagers in a cyberworld, making up names and stories and sending out romantic lies? What did he deserve but this aimless walk in a world where the only reason for him to live was so that his mother could die in her own bed? There must be places for a man like him to go, inexpensive foot-massage shops where, behind an unwashed curtain, a jaded young woman from the countryside would run her hands where he directed her while she chatted with a companion behind another curtain. Or, if he was willing to spend more\u2014and he could, for he had few expenditures beyond his magazines and the Internet caf\u00e9, and had long ago stopped buying expensive brushes and paper and pretending to be an artist\u2014one of the bathing palaces would welcome him into its warmth, with a private room and a woman of his choice to wait on him. It was a few minutes after five when Teacher Fei arrived at the institute, betting that the girl\u2019s father was not the type to leave work early, since there would be little reason for him to hurry home. While Teacher Fei waited for a guard to inform the man of his arrival, he studied the plaque at the entrance to the institute. \u201cThe Association of Marxist Dialectical Materialism,\u201d it said, and it occurred to Teacher Fei that had his father been alive he would have said that it was the parasites in these institutes who had ended hope for Chinese philosophers. \u201cPlease do not get me wrong. I am a serious man,\u201d Teacher Fei said to the girl\u2019s father when he appeared. \u201cA man most sympathetic to your situation.\u201d \u201cI do not know you,\u201d the man said. Had Teacher Fei not known his age, he would have guessed him to be more than sixty; his hair was more gray than black, and his back was stooped with timidity. A man closer to death than most men his age, Teacher Fei thought. But perhaps he would have more peace to look forward to in death. A stranger could be one\u2019s best friend just as one\u2019s wife and daughter could be one\u2019s deadly enemies, Teacher Fei replied, and he suggested that they go out for tea or a quick drink. A small group of workers, on their way from the institute to the bus stop across the street, passed the pair of men; two women looked back at them and then talked in whispers to the group. The girl\u2019s father recoiled, and Teacher Fei wondered if the daughter knew that her father already lived in a prison cell, its bars invisible to the people in the street. They could go to the man\u2019s office for a chat, Teacher Fei offered, knowing that this was the last thing he would want. The father hurriedly agreed to go to a nearby diner instead. He was the kind of man who was easily bullied by the world, Teacher Fei thought, realizing with satisfaction that he had not sought out the wrong person. At the diner, the girl\u2019s father chose a table in the corner farthest from the entrance, and in the dim light he squinted at the bench, wiping off some grease before he sat down. When the waitress came, Teacher Fei asked for a bottle of rice liquor and a plate of assorted cold cuts. He was not a drinker, nor had he ever touched marinated pig liver or tongue, but he imagined that a friendship between two men should start over harsh liquor and variety meats. Neither spoke for a moment. When their order came, Teacher Fei poured some liquor for the girl\u2019s father. A good drink wipes out all pain for a man, Teacher Fei said, and then poured a glass for himself, but it soon became clear that neither of them would touch the drink or the meat, the man apparently feeling as out of place in the dingy diner as Teacher Fei did. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Teacher Fei asked when the silence between them began to attract prying glances from the middle-aged proprietress of the diner, who sat behind the counter and studied the few occupied tables. The man shook his head. \u201cI do not understand the question,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you should sue your daughter,\u201d Teacher Fei said, and immediately saw the man freeze with hostility. Perhaps someone had approached him with a similar proposition already. Or perhaps that was why the young girl had sued her father in the first place, egged on by an attorney, a manipulative man using her rage for his own gain. Not that he could offer any legal help, Teacher Fei explained. He had been an art teacher in an elementary school before his retirement. He was in no position to do anything to hurt the girl\u2019s father, nor did he have the power to help him in his situation. It was only that he had followed his daughter\u2019s story in the media, and when he had seen the family picture he had known that he needed to do something for the girl\u2019s father. \u201c \u2018How many people in this world would understand this man\u2019s pain?\u2019 I asked myself when I saw your picture.\u201d The girl\u2019s father flinched. \u201cI am not the kind of man you think I am,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d Teacher Fei asked, failing to understand his meaning. He was not into other men, the girl\u2019s father said, so could Teacher Fei please stop this talk of friendship. The proprietress, who had been loitering around the nearby tables checking on the soy-sauce bottles, perked up despite the man\u2019s hushed voice. It took Teacher Fei a moment to grasp what the man was hinting at. Nor am I who you think I am, he thought of protesting, but why should he, when he had long ago made the decision not to defend himself against this ridiculous world? The proprietress approached the table and asked about the quality of the food and drink. When the man did not reply, Teacher Fei said that they were very fine. The woman chatted for a moment about the weather, and returned to her counter. Only then did the man insist that it was time for him to go home. \u201cWho is waiting at home?\u201d Teacher Fei asked, and the man, taken aback, stood up and said he really needed to leave. \u201cPlease,\u201d Teacher Fei said, looking up at the man. \u201cCould you stay for just a minute?\u201d If he sounded pathetic, he did not care. \u201cYou and I . . . ,\u201d he said slowly, glancing over at the entrance to the diner, where a pair of college students, a girl and a boy, were studying the menu on the wall. \u201cWe are the kind of men who would not kick our feet or flail our arms if someone came to strangle us to death. Most people would assume that we must be guilty if we did not fight back. A few would think us crazy or stupid. A very few would perhaps consider us men with dignity. But you and I alone know that they are all wrong, do not we?\u201d The man, who was about to leave some money on the table, tightened his fingers around the bills. Teacher Fei watched the college students take seats by the window, the boy covering the girl\u2019s hands with his own on the table. When the man sat back down, Teacher Fei nodded gratefully. He did not want to look up, for fear that the man would see his moist eyes. \u201cWhen I was twenty-four, I was accused of falling in love with a girl student,\u201d he said. \u201cPedophile\u201d had been the word used in the file at the school, the crime insinuated in the conversations taking place behind his back. The girl was ten and a half, an ordinary student, neither excelling among her classmates nor falling behind; one often encountered children like her in teaching, faces that blended into one another, names misrecalled from time to time, but there was something in the girl\u2019s face, a quietness that did not originate from shyness or absent-mindedness, as it usually did in children of her age, that intrigued Teacher Fei. He envisioned her at different ages\u2014fifteen, twenty, thirty\u2014but there was little desire in that imagining other than the desire to understand a face that had moved him as no other face had. \u201cNo, do not ask any questions, just as I will not ask whether you indeed kept a mistress while being married to your wife. It does not matter what happened between your cousin and you, or my girl student and me. You see, these accusations exist for the sake of those who feel the need to accuse. If it was not your cousin, there would have been another woman to account for your not loving your wife enough, no?\u201d The man took a sip from his glass, spilling the liquor when he put it down. He apologized for his clumsiness. \u201cMy mother used to say that people in this country were very good at inventing crimes, but, better still, we were good at inventing punishments to go with them,\u201d Teacher Fei said. When he and his cousin were young, they had vowed to marry each other, the man said; a children\u2019s game mostly, for when the time came they had drifted apart. She was widowed when they met again, and he had tried to help her find a job in the city, but she had never been his mistress. \u201cYou do not have to explain these things to me,\u201d Teacher Fei said. \u201cHad I not known to trust you, I would not have looked for you.\u201d The man could say a thousand things to defend himself, but people, his own daughter among them, would just laugh in his face and call him a liar. The crime that Teacher Fei had been accused of amounted to nothing more than a few moments of gazing, but one of the other students, a precocious eleven-year-old, had told her parents of the inappropriate attention the young teacher had paid to her classmate; later, when other girls were questioned, they seemed to be caught easily in the contagious imagination. He had just been curious, Teacher Fei said when he was approached by the principal. About what, he was pressed, but he could not explain how a face could contain so many mysteries visible only to those who knew what to look for. His reticence, more than anything, caused fury among the parents and his fellow-teachers. In the end, he chose to be called the name that had been put in the file: a man\u2019s dirty desire was all his accusers could grasp. \u201cOne should never hope for the unseeing to see the truth,\u201d Teacher Fei said now. \u201cI could have denied all the accusations, but what difference would it have made?\u201d \u201cSo there was no . . . proof of any kind?\u201d the man said, looking interested for the first time. \u201cNothing to put me in jail for,\u201d Teacher Fei said. \u201cAnd someone just reported you?\u201d \u201cWe cannot blame a young girl\u2019s imagination, can we?\u201d Teacher Fei said. The man met Teacher Fei\u2019s eyes. It was just the kind of thing his daughter would have done, the man said. \u201cShe would have made sure you lost your job,\u201d he added with a bitter smile, surprising Teacher Fei with his humor. \u201cCount yourself a lucky person.\u201d Teacher Fei nodded. He had won the district mural contest for the school every year, his ambition and training in art making him a craftsman in the end, but should not he consider it good fortune that his ability to paint the best portrait of Chairman Mao in the district had saved him from losing his job? The time to think about marriage had come and then gone, his reputation such that no matchmaker wanted to bet a girl\u2019s future on him. Still, his parents had treated him with gentle respect, never once questioning him. But, as cleaners of public toilets, they could do little to comfort him other than to leave him undisturbed in his solitude. Indeed, he was a lucky man, Teacher Fei said now; he had never married, so no one could accuse him of being an unfaithful husband or a bad father. \u201cUnwise of me to start a family, was not it?\u201d the girl\u2019s father said. \u201cBefore my divorce, my daughter said there were three things she would do. First, she would sue me and put me in prison. If that failed, she would find a way to let the whole world know my crime. And if that did not make me go back to her mother she would come with rat poison. Let me tell you\u2014now that she has done the first two things, I am waiting every day for her to fulfill her promise, and I count it as my good fortune to have little suspense left in my life.\u201d Teacher Fei looked at the college students paying at the counter, the boy counting money for the proprietress and the girl scanning the restaurant, her eyes passing over Teacher Fei and his companion without seeing them. \u201cI have nothing to say about this world,\u201d Teacher Fei said. Neither did he, the man replied, and they sat for a long time in silence till the proprietress approached again and asked if they needed more food. Both men brought out their wallets. \u201cLet me,\u201d Teacher Fei said, and though the man hesitated for a moment, he did not argue. In the dusk, a thin mist hung in the air. The two men shook hands as they parted. There was little more for them to say to each other, and Teacher Fei watched the man walk down the street, knowing that nothing would be changed by their brief meeting. He thought about his mother, who would be eager to see him return, though she would not show her anxiety to Mrs. Luo. He thought about his girl student: fifty-two she would be now, no doubt a wife and mother herself, and he hoped that he had not been mistaken and she had grown into a woman like his mother. She\u2014the girl student, whom he had never seen again\u2014would outlive him, just as his mother had outlived his father, their beauty and wisdom the saving grace for a man like him, a man like his father. But for the other man, who would be watching the night fall around the orange halo of the street lamps with neither longing nor dread, what did the future offer but the comfort of knowing that he would, when it was time for his daughter to carry out her plan of revenge, co\u00f6perate with a gentle willingness?",
    "FindingsImpressions": "My first glimpse of her was of a single small breast. Flashed on the X-ray screen. Lit in contrast. A hint, just a bump of fatty tissue against the chest cavity. Next to it, its close twin. Asymmetrical like most women's breasts. A far cry from spectacular. Straninsky, Alicia: the way her name first appeared to me, across a computerized label on her medical chart. A name that brought back memories of my Polish grandmother stuffing pierogis with thick fingers, the faint smells of the Baltic Sea that wafted from her sweat ers, the way she swayed her hips as she sang \"Hej, g?rale, nie bijcie siy. Ma g?ralka dwa warkocze podzielicie siyl\" Other information I learned: Age 32; Single; No history of breast irregularities; No children; Allergies to penicillin. What I saw: The usual striations indicating a buildup of calcium. What I also saw: Just past the spiculated masses of microcalcification, something that fanned out to form a white mass. An uneven density in the left quadrant of the right breast. About cancer: Mention this word, and people talk about randomness, about mystery. But the guesswork is mostly in why it forms. Once it hits you, charting the course of the disease is pretty much a mat ter of exact science, despite the runaround health professionals will give, despite the stories of miraculous recoveries. Even as a radiologist, I can predict who will make it and who will be a goner and it is of little surprise when the condemned grow weaker with each visit and then simply stop showing up. Where I have been wrong: It still stuns me to see the 82-year-old World War II vet who shuffles in every six months, his steps made small by the humongous growth on his hipbone the doctors left him to carry to his grave three years ago. Then there was the soccer player, a sixteen-year-old with more muscles in her calves than most men could flex in the length of their legs. She should have fallen into the category of healthy children who recover largely unscathed from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She came in every few months with a flock of friends, their heads shaven in solidarity. They practically sprinted into the office, death for them a thing too distant even in a hospital basement. But in less than a year, the slippery thing in her bones had burrowed its way into her head and her brain began to swell and then she wobbled in, first on a cane, and then a walker, even its four legs not proving sturdy enough for her trembling hands. Her mother stopped calling for appointments and then, when a year passed, I had the intern call her doctor and move her files to one of the cabinets marked deceased. What a radiologist does: Nick, my seven-year-old, periodically asks me to explain. I look at pictures of sick people, I tell him. There are the one-timers: fractures, sprains, chest X-rays for pneumonia. But mostly, I search for benign tumors, lesions, and cancer. I suggest biopsies to seal diagnoses. I look for patterns of tissue density. The skill of a radiologist is in determining what is harmless and what will have to be cut out or irradiated. For years, I have not been able to sleep with a woman without subjecting her to thorough analysis. I poke in the usual spots and work three fingers in circular motion. My onetime wife, good Lillian with her sense of humor, would offer me her breasts, cupping them while I searched for sinister growth under her soft skin. What I failed to diagnose: The slickness of the roads in an intense April rain, the impatience of Baltimore drivers after a 17-20 loss by the Ravens against the Titans in overtime, the sudden, illogical curvature of I-95 near the Russell Street ramp, Lillian's eyes fatigued after filing another late-night report for the wxip eleven of the clock news. How easy it must have been for her to sink into the plush leather seat, to let her eyes glaze over the sea of red brake lights, to let her mind settle onto the party for Nick's third birthday, how effortlessly the impact would have crushed her beautiful skull. I should have been prepared for: The cruelty of grief. 3 For months, Nick looked for Lillian on the evening news. When he saw Lillian's replacement?an eerily close copy of my wife with shoulder-length blond hair, he yelled, Mommy! pointing to the TV. Mommy! he demanded several times a day, often just as I would gathered enough focus to vacuum or wash a load of laundry. I took the boy through the talk, telling him of the changing seasons, of molting snakes, of butterflies and cocoons, of how everything that lives must die. I took him down to the river where we would said goodbye to what could be salvaged of Mommy, and finally when the boy could not be made to understand, I turned on the TV night after night, putting him to sleep with his digital mom. Say good bye to Mommy, I would say when he struggled to keep his eyes open until the end of the newscast, and he would wave a chunky, sleepy hand to Linda Jones of wxip. When he kissed his surrogate mother good night, his thin hair turned all static. Maybe I took the easy way out. Tell Mommy you love her, I encour aged. And he would babble incomprehensible reviews of his day and declare all kinds of love and ask for promises impossible to keep. After a few months, he asked with a tired voice one Saturday morn ing, When is Mommy coming home? And I said, doing my best to look him straight in his eyes, She cannot leave the TV, my little man. I called him what Lillian would when he would done something exceptionally good for her, like pouring milk into her cereal long before she would sat down at the table or offering half-melted M&M's from his palm. Nick began to look for Lillian inside the TV. He clawed at it with pink fingers. What friends suggested: Get out there again. Married friends, espe cially, said with feigned enthusiasm, \"One of us has to keep this interesting.\" They flattered me, called me Sean the Man. Lady Killer Miller. They envied my brief relationship with a part-time lingerie model. But after the accident, they held their wives closer. Transition into relationships: It sounded doable, almost. But there seemed no clear end to grief and the beginning of happiness. I expected the fluttering of the heart on first dates. I allowed myself to turn into a romantic. I put on freshly ironed shirts. I spritzed cologne and felt for butterflies in my stomach. But even with Tanya, even after sex with a model, the kind of sex that made me shudder 4 with force, something would creep up?an image, a recollection of a graze, the way Lillian and I giggled like teenagers after making loud love into the pillow to keep Nick from waking?and, always, it would make me turn my back in a heavy way while Tanya stroked my back and said she understood, that I should talk to somebody about loss, about starting anew. When Alicia Straninsky appears: She surprises me by coming in person to pick up the CT report. Normally, I send these off directly to the doctors. I am surprised to see that Alicia's shockingly short?only about five feet tall. But more than that, I am unprepared to see so much vitality. Her cheeks are ruddy in a way that must make her seem permanently embarrassed. She looks like she might never have stretched out properly from a child's portly body. She has sub stantial arms and legs, like those of hefty old women who can chop wood and move a refrigerator. Something about her smells vaguely like cinnamon. All I can think is, I have never seen a chubby woman with small breasts. \"Did you have a question, Miss?\" \"Yes. I would like this explained.\" No patient has questioned me on my reports. The normal course of things involves a statement of my findings and impressions. I make recommendations, suggest checkups. I make no promises and no advisements. So-and-so has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, I write in my reports. It is the oncologists who will talk to newly retired couples about debilitating therapies. It is they who are left to explain to teary-eyed parents why modern medicine could not save their children. But Alicia reads over my report, right in front of me. Although I forget my brother's birthday and seldom call the parents of Nick's playmates by their correct names, I can mouth along with every word Alicia reads. Findings: Malignant tumor with diameter measuring 5cm in the lower left quadrant of right breast. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3. Metastatic carcinoma involving two of thirteen axillary lymph nodes. No nipple involvement noted. No indication of abnor mal growth in the contralateral breast. 5 Impressions: Stage ni invasive carcinoma of the breast. \"So what does this mean?\" Alicia asks, her cheeks impossibly pinker than before. \"You will have to talk to your doctor.\" \"You are an MD, right?\" she asks, and I tell her this is true. \"It is Friday. You are going to make me wait all weekend? Monday's a holiday.\" I agree with her again. There is something about that face, a cer tain helplessness that inexplicably reminds me of Nick after he is dropped his ice cream cone. I am not sure why I give in, but I explain the major thrust of the pathology report and wait a minute for her to digest this. Nothing changes in her expression. All she says is, \"How can you be so sure? Just from pictures?\" \"And from your biopsy.\" \"I see. The little needle can tell all this?\" \"That is right.\" \"In my ducts?\" \"That is where it often starts.\" \"I guess I am never breastfeeding.\" \"Do you have children?\" \"No. But I guess this rules that out.\" \"Not necessarily. You should talk to your doctor.\" After a while, she says. \"So what does this mean, though? I mean, what are my prospects here?\" \"You have to talk to your doctor. He can tell you better what to do from here.\" \"Right. I do not suppose I can ask that of you. Thanks. It was kind of you to explain this.\" A week passes. I do not think about Alicia, but I do pull into work each morning with some vague anticipation. When she next appears: \"Hey,\" Alicia says to me, a woman with a yel low parka pulled over her head. I am returning from lunch and had broken into a jog because I have forgotten my umbrella at the restau rant. \"You are the radiologist.\" \"Hi,\" I reply before I recognize her. She has the same ruddiness in the cheeks, but dressed in yellow, she looks like one of the plastic ducks I use to lure Nick into the bath. 6 \"About to go in for my first radiation,\" she says. \"You were right, I guess. I got something in there that is not good news.\" \"Good luck to you,\" I say and then wonder what more appropri ate, reassuring things might be expected from someone with years of medical training. \"What is the deal with these hospitals? They have a different per son doing every part of your treatment. I thought I would be seeing you, but I see a radiologist who just does radiation oncology?\" \"That is right. We are all one-trick ponies, I guess.\" She does not laugh. I catch a glimpse of a cigarette between her fingers. \"You know, you should give those up.\" She offers me one and says, \"It is only ex-smokers who say things like that. You born-agains.\" There is nothing for me to say. We let the soft patter of the rain do our work. I try to keep my lungs from burning as I inhale hard on the damp Camels. When I pull out of the parking lot at the end of the day, the rain has died down, leaving a general mist. I recognize Alicia right away. Her yellow parka is bright even through the haze. She is sitting at the bus stop, a newspaper folded under her to absorb the rainwater. \"Alicia,\" I call out. It takes her a minute to realize where the voice is coming from. She spots my open window and stares hard, squints. She walks over and ducks her head toward me, keeping herself well within running distance. \"It is Sean, the radiologist.\" It is odd to identify myself this way. \"Hi,\" she says, not moving. \"It is raining. Where are you headed?\" \"Home. Morrell Park,\" she adds. \"I am driving that way,\" I offer, but she gives no response. \"Well, jump in if you want.\" Alicia enters slowly, planting herself squarely in the seat before swinging her legs in. We drive out of the lot and into traffic in silence until it occurs to me to ask about her treatment. \"You feeling OK?\" \"It was not as bad as they say. Although your first time's supposed to be the easiest.\" \"That is what they say.\" 7 I follow her sparse directions, and when I pull up to a block of row houses, she says, \"This is good\" in front of a fading tan unit. We sit in silence, staring ahead. \"Nice house.\" \"There is not that much inside. I just moved down here. I would planned on fixing it up a bit.\" \"Looks fine to me as is,\" I say. She catches me watching a torrent of water bypass a gutter that hangs broken off the roof. She presses her lips, trying to suppress a laugh. \"Feel better,\" I manage to mutter. \"Thanks,\" she says, and I am not sure if she means this for the ride or the failed compliment. The second time she comes in: Alicia takes me by surprise because it is been only weeks since her last exam. On the form, I see she is scrawled, next to changes since last exam, \"subcutaneous mastectomy.\" And indeed, her breast has been scooped out, sparing her nipple but leaving her with even less tissue than before. Still, this is enough flesh to require routine monitoring. \"How've you been?\" I ask, unable to make the moment less awk ward, this attempt at exchanging pleasantries before I crush the remainder of her breasts between glass plates. She is clutching the back of the thin hospital gown, making laborious efforts to keep its ends together. I help Alicia position one breast at a time onto the bottom plate. \"Sorry. It will be cold,\" I warn her. I switch on the machine and let the compressor do its work. In the end, I have to manually squeeze the plates to spread the meager amount of fat across the glass. She takes it heroically, wincing briefly. Other women, big-busted women for whom this is a less painful process, yell and curse. \"You know, it might be easier, it would hurt less if you came in when you are not so tender. The week after your menstruation,\" I say as I help her retie her gown. \"Thank you.\" \"You might be sore today. If it gets really bad, take a Tylenol.\" I prepare my patients for everything. Everything except how the dis ease itself will ravage them. 8 There were no ways to prep Nick for the mourning. Lillian simply did not come home one night; there was no process to his mother's dying. Each year, on Nick's birthday, we go to the Patapsco to visit Lillian on the anniversary of her river burial. Afterwards, we go for cheeseburgers and I buy Nick the works, everything off the menu. Last year, he asked between bites, \"So she is just swimming around?\" This took me by surprise, and I had to sip my soda for a while before I could formulate an answer. \"Mom never wanted to be boxed in.\" \"Dad.\" He did not say anything until he had my full attention again. \"Can I have my ashes spread?\" \"Hey, that is no way for a boy to talk,\" I said sternly. When the waitress came around, I ordered us banana splits. I even insisted on brownies?Nick's favorite. When Nick asks Why did Mommy have to go away?, I have no reasons to give him. I command him to take a bath and go to sleep. I watch his pajama legs disappear down the hall and wonder how even his walk could be like that of the mother he could not possibly remember in physical detail. I can hardly look at him when he stands with the sun slanting onto his head, his hair a shade like Lillian's. After I buried Lillian, I found I could not get rid of even the things I would sworn I hated. The dog that pissed on the couch reminded me of Lillian showing up one day with the terrier, saying, \"She is lost. Look, no tags,\" as if that were all the explanation needed. The pot pourri she would introduced to the bathroom I could not throw away even after it had disintegrated to red dust. The miniature toys lined on the windowsill were reminders of our trip to Belgium, where, instead of cerise and framboise, we ate too many egg-shaped choco lates that opened to reveal plastic surprises. I would had to move to another part of the city just so Lillian would not pop up suddenly while I was on line at the supermarket, show her face in the bath room mirror as I shaved, slip her way to the side of the bed at night as I willed myself to sleep. The routine we have fallen into: I see Alicia every week now. Since Radiation Oncology is next to my office, I drive her home. It is no way for a weak woman to travel, waiting for a public bus, inhaling 9 exhaust, and pushing through the crowd for a seat. She thanks me profusely. They have stepped up her treatment so that in addition to the radia tion, she is on chemotherapy. She is thinning out, not so much in her torso, but in unexpected places like her neck and elbows. Her ankles and knees look like skin coming loose. Since I will not take money for gas, Alicia insists on stopping for coffee and muffins, though she usually does not buy anything for herself. As the summer progresses, we drive to the harbor. She is from Chicago and says the ocean opens her lungs up. The chemo makes her skin turn a dry brown in the sun, and so we sit in the car and roll down the windows and breathe in the ocean. These are not dates. But when there is the protection of clouds, we walk along the water and eat ice cream. Later, when she becomes too weak, we sit in the car and watch joggers and bicycles zip by. I wonder if Lillian's traveled this far, or if she is already passed out of the Atlantic, floated down to the Caribbean Sea. Things have an odd way of traveling in open water. Perhaps the bits of Lillian have swum their way to all parts of the world. I would once read about toy ducks that fell off a freighter container and all over South America, Northern Europe, and Africa, beachgoers found armies of smil ing yellow ducks bobbing in over the surf and nesting among the seagulls. \"What did you do in Chicago?\" I ask Alicia as the early evening strollers begin to descend en masse. \"You name it. I have done it. I was a nanny. I worked as a secretary to a pervert. I walked a herd of dogs for yuppies. You know Ann Sathers?\" \"The cinnabuns?\" \"I worked in the factory.\" \"Really?\" \"Quality assurance. I ate a lot of cinnabuns.\" I wonder if that is why she still smells like cinnamon. On days when Alicia is well enough, she is famished. Today, she wants hot dogs. \"You cannot deny food to a woman who has cancer!\" She has no qualms about playing the sympathy card. She piles on mustard and ketchup and then sauerkraut on two franks. \"Ketard! Get it?\" she jabs me with a weak elbow and I let out a small laugh. She is chewing grape gum?something that she says 10 helps her nausea?and from time to time, I catch flashes of purple between teeth and tongue. \"Where is your little boy?\" she asks as we sit down at a bench table. \"I mean, when you are not watching him. Is there somebody who takes care of him?\" She spits out the gum into her hands and I cannot focus on anything because I am wondering what she is done with it. I am tempted to duck my head under the table to see if she is playing with it between her fingers. \"Where there are colleges, there are babysitters,\" I say, and she seems satisfied. \"So I am freezing my eggs. Do you think it will work? It is still not a sure thing, but you can conserve them. You know, fertilize them later. A lot of women on chemo are doing it now.\" \"That is a smart thing to do.\" \"They basically drain the eggs out of you and keep them floating in liquid nitrogen.\" \"That sounds splendid. Sounds like one of Nick's science proj ects.\" \"Your son must be great. Kids are great.\" \"Most of the time.\" \"I thought I would have plenty of time to have kids.\" I am not sure how to respond, and when she sees me just staring at the water, she says, \"I had chances to, you know?\" She smiles. \"Shit happens, as they say.\" Alicia chews hungrily, only intermittently bothering to wipe the orange mix of ketard from the corners of her mouth. There is some thing admirable in her embrace of joy, however temporary. Even if it will make her sick, even if in two hours she could throw it all up, she will not be denied satiation. When I tell Alicia about Tanya, she is amazed. We are comparing our biggest bragging rights. She says she once guessed the number of jellybeans in a giant jar and won two thousand dollars, and I come back with, I once dated a woman who made a living in bra and panties. She wants pictures of her. \"You are bullshiting,\" she says. \"That is the oldest lie in the book.\" For the next week, I search for Tanya in Macy's flyers. She mod eled regularly for their lingerie section, and now she is apparently moved on to modeling business suits for them. 11 \"You are kidding,\" Alicia says when I hand her the clipped flyer. Today, we have driven to a different pier to watch the late afternoon sun paint the bay in shifting colors of emerald green and pink. \"I am not a pictures guy.\" She flashes a smile. \"A true romantic. Wow. Is that her?\" \"It was not a big deal.\" \"Gosh. I have never looked like that in my life.\" With the dramatic weight loss, Alicia's deep-set eyes seem to burrow toward the back of her head. Her thinning hair is now brassy. She leafs through the rest of the flyer. \"This is depressing. I have never been in a dress that resembles anything like these, you know?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You know, I have never felt?pretty. Like one of those girls with perfect hair and skin. The kind that know how to flirt with guys.\" She catches me open and close my mouth, fishing for something to say. \"The only good thing about getting sick is I am finally skinny.\" \"I remember,\" she continues when I do not respond, \"I went to the prom with a family friend my mother basically strongarmed into taking me. Mortifying, right? Well, I thought, hey, I will make the best of it. I will at least get a nice black dress. I thought those were so elegant. So royal. But of course the only thing that fit me and I could afford was this puffy magenta thing. It made me look like a giant cherry! I spent half the night in the bathroom. I just wanted to disappear down the toilet.\" \"Do not talk like that,\" I say and Alicia looks at me with some expectation. \"Do not ever think that again. You are beautiful,\" I add after a while. The way her face opens up, the way Alicia's eyes become liquid, suddenly make even the possibility of her disappearance unbear able. I think, maybe I have never realized the possible permutations of beauty. For her birthday, Alicia has decided to throw herself a backyard barbeque party. She is insisted I come with Nick. I would love to meet your son, and there will be other kids, she urged. She is set up an inflatable pool and a trampoline. When we get there, the only kids I see are infant twins. There are fewer than ten people, all neighbors. Alicia emerges from the kitchen with a tray of hot dogs. She has on a sundress and a wide 12 brimmed hat. She is wearing makeup, and she smiles at me with two lines of thin red lips. For the first time, I notice freckles that fan out from one ear to the other. \"Hey there,\" she says when Nick hands her a bouquet of flowers. \"Are not you just a charmer! Well, I heard you like brownies. Guess what we are making!\" She let us Nick mix the batter. He licks his fin gers while Alicia clowns around, smearing chocolate on his cheeks. They turn on the oven light and watch the brownies rise. While we eat, Nick has his run of the yard. He does impossible jumps on the trampoline. \"Wonderful,\" Alicia says. \"It must be wonderful having him in your life. We should do this more. My nephews are back in Chicago. I miss having kids around.\" She lights a cigarette. \"I do not know why I have put my life on hold for so long. You know, now it is like I do not want to waste another minute. I am doing all these things I have always wanted to do, because what am I waiting for? Carpe diem.\" \"What kinds of things?\" I ask. \"Oh, the South Pacific. I have been watching these travel videos. I have always wanted to go there.\" \"What else?\" I ask. I do not imagine even she can see herself get ting on a long plane ride any time soon. \"Well, getting involved with somebody, I guess.\" She crushes her cigarette under her sandals. \"So how come you never moved on? You, know, really moved on? I mean, do you ever think Nick would want someone in his life again?\" As if summoned by his mention, Nick runs up to us, asking Alicia to jump with him on the trampoline. \"Oh, Nick, I do not know if I can do that,\" she says. \"But do you want to watch videos? Have you been to an island where there are pirates?\" Nick stops talking and his eyes widen. \"You know what they have in the South Pacific? Cocoa trees. That is where chocolates come from.\" From the confusion on his face, I see Nick cannot imagine chocolate that is not wrapped in foil. \"I am planning to go there. Maybe we can all go together if your dad let us you. Would you like that?\" she asks with a wink. On the drive back, Nick recounts the ways in which he loves Alicia. I like her pool. I like her jumping thing, he says. She is the best brownie maker. \"Can we come play next Saturday?\" he pleads. \"Maybe, Nick.\" \"She said I can come over anytime.\" 13 \"We will see about that.\" \"Why do we have to see?\" he asks in a voice like a goat's bleat. I see in the rearview mirror his eyes begin to tear. What three-month checkups reveal: In the fall, Alicia comes in for her exam, cheerful as though she. were only stopping by for a social visit. \"I am having another get together this weekend,\" she says, sliding up to me while I help a patient with his forms. I tell her that things are too busy and she says, \"OK, sure,\" but she lingers. \"Another time then?\" she asks when the assistant comes to lead her away. She does not seem a bit embarrassed while the intern helps her at the machine. She does not cringe as the stranger's hands shift her breasts now here and then there. It is the response of a woman whose body has become a thing of science, who is stripped repeated ly for doctors and nurses and technicians. Her body has been poked at, argued about by oncologists, examined with cold instruments, described only in clinical terms. I catch a glimpse of her bra as she redoes her gown. It is a white cotton thing. No frills. No contrap tions to lift and push together. Plain as day. I stand over the technician as he processes her pictures. I want to shut my eyes when a new mass comes to life, because there it is, in her thigh, a stubborn growth that has planted despite the dual attacks by radiation and chemicals. I file an updated report: Distant osteolytic metastasis to femur in left leg. What I want to tell her: You should be spared. If I had the power to rip this thing out of you, if only I could sieve the little cells of poison swimming around in your lymph and blood. What is ahead: Bone pain. And the slow perforation of the skeleton. I call to tell her the news myself. She says, \"Give it to me straight, doc.\" \"Do not call me that.\" \"OK, Sean. Lay it on me. Tell me how bad it is going to be.\" H \"It is spread.\" There is no way to soften the blow \"It is gone into your bones.\" \"I see.\" \"You will probably have to increase the treatment. I called your doc tor already. This is not uncommon. They have medicines for every complication.\" I let myself believe what my patients often say: that fighting cancer is 99% mental. \"You are a sweetie. Give my love to Nick. I would love to see him again.\" What I withhold from her: Only 10-20% make it at this stage. After the leg, the cancer will wind its way to the pelvis. Then: to the lungs and then shortness of breath. Next: the liver. Her skin will yellow and become puffy. There will be an unprecedented loss of weight until finally, Alicia will not be able to eat. Then: the brain. With her new treatment, I cannot drive Alicia home because she is in and out by the early afternoon. But when I catch glimpses of her in the hospital, I see there is a definite yellowness to her face. The roundness of her cheeks is gone. Her skin, darkened by the chemi cals pumped into her body, is dry. It reminds me of cracked African earth after years of drought. Today, she has a fantastic green scarf on her head. She looks like some odd goddess heralding in the spring, except there is no trace of vitality about her anymore. We comment on the rain and she jokes about her hair falling out. \"Positive attitude's the cure, right?\" she asks. \"That is the key.\" \"Hey, how about a ball game sometime? Nick would like that, would not he?\" \"We should do that,\" I say, my tone betraying the conviction of my words. Alicia let us out a small laugh. \"Sean,\" she says. \"Did I do some thing? I mean, I thought we were all getting along great.\" \"It is not that.\" \"What is it then?\" I let a minute pass while we walk down the hall. After a few paces, she says, \"C'mon, I can handle it.\" \"It is just that,\" I say, then cannot finish. 15 \"What is it just?\" She stares, unflinching. \"What?\" she asks more sharply. \"It is Nick. He latches on.\" She scrutinizes my face, waiting for more explanation, and I have to look away. \"I do not want to hurt him again.\" The resolution of my voice surprises me. \"Oh. I see.\" She twirls the ends of her scarf. \"Ah, now I got you.\" \"Alicia.\" I reach to touch her arm but she shies away. \"No, that is all right. It is all right.\" We have reached the hospital exit, and she peers out the glass doors, checking the rain outside. \"See you around,\" she says. When she walks away, all she leaves is a muddy boot print. Months later, I am woken up by a call. \"This is Ed. I am Alicia Straninsky's ex,\" a deep voice announces. \"Ex?\" \"Husband. Geez. Did I wake you? I did not think you would be sleep ing.\" \"No, no.\" I start to explain how I have been working late hours. \"Is she OK?\" I manage to mumble. I cannot find my glasses. \"Not quite. She is had a fall, doc. She broke her hip. You were listed on her emergency contact form.\" I put on my glasses and the room comes into sudden focus. \"Husband?\" I ask in a more clear tone. \"Well, from years ago.\" I would not know it is sleeting except the minute I am out of the car, my wet clothes freeze onto my skin. I do not even remember turning on the wipers. In the emergency room, the nurse points me to Ed, a man consider ably older than Alicia. A woman in her twenties is holding his hand. Ed has a scruffy look like most people here, but with him, it seems possible that even without an emergency, he might look exactly this way His hair is a nest of dark brown and he is wearing a Black Sabbath T-shirt with Paranoid written across his chest. The shirt is tattered in unexpected places: near the bellybutton, on his upper arm, by the clavicle. He shakes my hand vigorously and thanks me. \"How is she doing?\" 16 \"We have not been told anything, except to wait.\" The young woman nods her head. She cannot be more than a college kid. \"I wish she would told me. I had no idea.\" Ed scratches his head for a long time. \"Thank god she still had me on the forms. We made each other health proxies, but that is when we were married. That is Alicia for you. Good with planning. Not so good with the follow through.\" We make small talk. Ed teaches sociology. He and Alicia were married for less than a year. He wanted children. She did not. We chat about the weather. \"It is not my business, I suppose, but I thought you were her doc tor. I would not have woken you. It said Dr. Sean so I thought we would better call you.\" \"Well, I am her radiologist.\" \"I see,\" Ed says, looking puzzled. \"Like you take her X-rays?\" When we are finally taken to see Alicia, she is lying with a pillow between her legs. They will take her into surgery, reconnect her hips with screws. \"Oh, hi,\" she says, not directed at either of us. She looks to Ed and says, \"Good to see you,\" and waves to me. \"I cannot believe you both are here,\" she says shyly, as if we have thrown her some surprise party. Ed fills her in on the new college where he teaches. I show them pictures of Nick in his Halloween costume. So it takes a little boy to make you a pictures guy, Alicia says. I stay to help Ed with the forms, but leave before they wheel Alicia back, still fractured, in pain, held up with metal. I have never known how to say a proper goodbye. In March, Alicia is back to check for more distant metastasis. She comes in in a wheelchair. Even seated, she seems barely capable of holding up her weight. Her lips are pale and cracked. Her breathing is labored for the brief time we chat. She asks if Nick is well and I say we should go to the harbor sometime, grab hot dogs. Sure, she says, emptily. Later, Alicia waves a wan hand and mouths a soft Bye. I pretend I am busy with paperwork and nod a quick acknowledg ment. Heartless, we call oncologists who abandon the patients they cannot save. Cowards, we say of husbands who flee rather than see their wives suffer. I place the X-ray vest too hard on a fifty-five year-old man who is come in for a pelvic exam. I shuffle through his charts with some force. 17 What would otherwise be a perfect day: When the second call comes from Ed, it is a beautiful, dry June day. Nick has agreed to try a baseball day camp and I am plotting the rest of our summer?Little League, season tickets behind the dugout at Camden Yards, and a trip to Hershey Park where Nick can discover chocolate heaven. It is been weeks since he is asked about Alicia. There is no hint of humidity, no heavy rains, and I sit in my car and wait patiently for the traffic to thin out from the afternoon game. In all of Baltimore, it is a perfectly ordinary day. I see Ed in the hospital ward, next to a young woman rubbing his shoulders. I cannot be sure it is the same girlfriend from the winter. He gets up to shake my hand. He is a broken man. \"Thanks for coming. I know she would have wanted you here. She considered you a friend. She did not really have a network here.\" His eyes fill with tears. The girlfriend strokes his arm and Ed holds up a hand to signal that he is OK. \"Anyway, you were on the short list. Told you she was organized. There was a sort of phone chain. Well, she did not know that many people. I have no fucking idea how these things work,\" he says, waving an arm over the empty corridor. There is the distinctive odor of antiseptic, evidence of eradication, of something made absent. For days, I take the long way from the basement elevator to my office, knowing she is somewhere in the morgue's drawers smelling of all kinds of noxious chemicals. The memorial the night before the burial is a New Age thing arranged by Ed. It is not an open casket event, but I am still surprised to see there is not even a coffin, no photos of Alicia as a kid or smil ing with Ed in healthier days. Ed has asked everyone to bring things that remind them of Alicia. I could not settle on anything, and on the way over, bought a cheese danish when I could not find a cinnamon bun. A woman walks up to the lectern holding an almanac. \"Alicia was all brains,\" she says rather gravely, and people clap. A man produces a bamboo stick and says, \"Alicia was all strength.\" Another woman waves a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird. \"For our stubborn tomboy,\" she says to a room that breaks out in laughter. I hold onto my Dunkin' Donuts bag while people shoot me curious looks. 18 When the ceremony is over, Ed is surrounded by people extend ing condolences. He spots me and says, \"Ah, the good doc. Great that you made it.\" \"Would not have missed it. Nice event. I mean, you know, for what it is.\" We let a soundless minute pass while Ed nods to several people. \"No pictures?\" \"Alicia wanted it this way. She was never showy. Never thought she was much to look at.\" \"Is there anything I can do?\" I ask. \"No, no. You have done so much already. Thank you.\" Outside, I cool my temple against the window of the Camry as car after car turns on its lights and winds its way out of the parking lot. Ed catches me as I am about to turn the keys in the ignition. He angles his head in. \"Actually, Sean, could you do me this one big favor? I have been going nuts here. Her mom is flying in and then her cousins are coming, and of course I have to pick them all up. Since you live in the neighborhood, would you mind dropping this off at the funeral home in the morning? It is her clothes.\" \"Anything to help.\" Then, as if remembering something, he blurts, \"Can you believe her mother did not come to the memorial? She thinks we are hippies, I suppose. That is Mrs. Straninsky for you. She hated me, that despi cable old woman,\" he says with a distant look. \"Do not worry. I got it, Ed.\" \"Yes, tomorrow, if you can go to the Funeral King, it would be great.\" He hands me a shopping bag. The end of the college semester has snuck up on me, and I cannot find a babysitter for the weekend. I drive to the Morell Park Funeral Home with Nick asleep in the back seat. It is a stately Gothic Revival manor, a castle-like structure that sits on acres of manicured gardens and reflecting pools. The funeral director is a colorful man widely known as the Funeral King, in part because he holds a monopoly on the burial business, and because he appears in TV ads promising, \"We treat your loved ones like royalty.\" It takes a long while before the Funeral King himself answers the bell. \"I am sorry for your loss,\" he says in a deep voice. \"Thank you.\" I hand over the bag. \"This is for Ms. Straninsky.\" 19 \"Ah. Lady Straninsky. Come in, come in, please.\" I walk a few steps into the parlor and point to Nick in the car. We watch Nick press his mouth against the window and puff his cheeks out like a blowfish. \"I am sorry, you are ?\" \"Her radiologist. I was also a friend. Is she...\" I begin to mutter but cannot stomach the thought that she is steps away in the base ment on some cold, metal table, her body drained of its fluids and her face powdered and rouged to an obscene color. \"She is almost ready,\" the Funeral King says, placing a hand on my arm. \"She is comfortable now.\" I think of how comfortable she might have been in her last days. I wonder whether Ed would have known to increase the pain medi cation only as needed to maximize its numbing effect. I wonder whether he would have soaked her feet in warm water, changed her sheets twice a day, massaged her sores, made her final moments somehow bearable. In her last week, she would have been incapable of communicating her most basic wishes?a shave of ice for her dry mouth, another drop of morphine, the need to be shifted in bed every few hours to relieve the pressure of one limb pressing on another. It should have been me there to listen for the mysterious rhythm of her final breaths. \"She is almost ready,\" the Funeral King says in a soothing baritone, his voice seeming to travel to me from somewhere far away. \"I will just make sure that everything's here.\" He ruffles through the bag. \"Well, actually, you seem to have forgotten her...undergarments. Do not worry,\" he says when I stare, puzzled. \"You are not the first. It is usual ly the thing people will forget.\" He opens the bag for me to examine. There is a white hat and gloves, along with a blue dress?a real '50's outfit. I wonder if Ed is out of his mind. There are even nylon stock ings, but no underwear. \"We usually keep some extras around, but I am sorry, we have been so busy and this is really cutting it close. If you would not mind just bringing some of her garments, we can take care of everything.\" He anticipates my objection. \"I would suggest, there is a mall a mile or so away. Do not worry,\" he says again. I must have looked terrified then. \"This happens all the time.\" In the Victoria's Secret, Nick tries to don a giant pair of angel wings. \"Oh, honey,\" a flustered saleswoman yells, \"those wings are not for 20 playing.\" Then she turns in my direction. The smell of her perfume hits me before she reaches me. I apologize and she says with a broad smile, \"All the kids love that. Are you looking for anything in particular?\" \"Yes, I am looking for underwear. And bras.\" \"Sure.\" \"It should be something special.\" \"Of course.\" She eyes Nick, who is now tugging the arm of a teddy bear that is part of a display. I make a face at him to stop. \"No. Something very special. For a beautiful woman.\" \"Well, we have many special things. We have these of course,\" she says, holding up a thong. \"These are very popular.\" \"We need something classy.\" \"Is there a specific color you had in mind?\" \"Let us see. Her dress is blue.\" \"Well, how about this in royal blue?\" She holds up a modest set of satin underwear. \"Classy but beautiful. It is what she is wearing.\" The saleswoman points to a large poster of a thin, voluptuous model she explains is Brazilian. \"Quite stunning,\" she says to her self. I buy the set and have her throw in the straps the model sports that seem to do nothing but to connect her stockings to her under wear. \"Practical and elegant,\" the saleswoman admires. \"Would you like some body lotion? It is called Amazon Goddess. It smells like the rainforest.\" I want to ask if she is ever smelled the rainforest, but I purchase a small bottle anyway. I think, For one day, Alicia, you will be the princess of Morrell Park, of ketard on hot dogs, of small breasts.",
    "NawabdinElectrician": "He flourished on a signature ability: a technique for cheating the electric company by slowing down the revolutions of its meters, so cunningly performed that his customers could specify to the hundred-rupee note the desired monthly savings. In this Pakistani desert, behind Multan, where the tube wells pumped from the aquifer day and night, Nawab\u2019s discovery eclipsed the philosopher\u2019s stone. Some thought he used magnets, others said heavy oil or porcelain chips or a substance he found in beehives. Skeptics reported that he had a deal with the meter men. In any case, this trick guaranteed Nawab\u2019s employment, both off and on the farm of his patron, K. K. Harouni. The farm lay strung along a narrow and pitted farm-to-market road, built in the nineteen-seventies, when Harouni still had influence in the Islamabad bureaucracy. Buff or saline-white desert dragged out between fields of sugarcane and cotton, mango orchards and clover and wheat, soaked daily by the tube wells that Nawabdin Electrician tended. Beginning the rounds of Nurpur Harouni on his itinerant mornings, summoned to a broken pump, Nawab and his bicycle bumped along, decorative plastic flowers swaying on wires sprouting from the frame. His tools, notably a three-pound ball-peen hammer, clanked in a greasy leather bag suspended from the handlebars. The farmhands and the manager waited in the cool of the banyans, planted years earlier to shade each of the tube wells. \u201cNo tea, no tea,\u201d Nawab insisted, waving away the steaming cup. Hammer dangling from his hand like a savage\u2019s axe, Nawab entered the oily room housing the pump and its electric motor. Silence. The men crowded the doorway till he shouted that he must have light. He approached the offending object warily but with his temper rising, circled it, pushed it about a bit, began to take liberties with it, settled in with it, called for a cup of tea next to it, and finally began disassembling it. With his long, blunt screwdriver he cracked the shields hiding the machine\u2019s penetralia, a screw popping loose and flying into the shadows. He took the ball-peen and delivered a crafty blow. The intervention failed. Pondering the situation, he ordered one of the farmworkers to find a really thick piece of leather and to collect sticky mango sap from a nearby tree. So it went, all morning and into the afternoon, Nawab trying one thing and then another, heating the pipes, cooling them, joining wires together, circumventing switches and fuses. And yet somehow, in fulfillment of the local genius for crude improvisation, the pumps continued to run. Unfortunately or fortunately, Nawab had married early in life a sweet woman of unsurpassed fertility, whom he adored, and she proceeded to bear him children spaced, if not less than nine months apart, then not that much more. And all daughters, one after another after another, until finally the looked-for son arrived, leaving Nawab with a complete set of twelve girls, ranging from toddler to age eleven, and one odd piece. If he had been governor of the Punjab, their dowries would have beggared him. For an electrician and mechanic, no matter how light-fingered, there seemed no question of marrying them all off. No moneylender in his right mind would, at any rate of interest, advance a sufficient sum to buy the necessary items for each daughter: beds, a dresser, trunks, electric fans, dishes, six suits of clothes for the groom, six for the bride, perhaps a television, and on and on and on. Another man might have thrown up his hands\u2014but not Nawabdin. The daughters acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course knew that he must proliferate his sources of revenue\u2014the salary he received from K. K. Harouni for tending the tube wells would not even begin to suffice. He set up a one-room flour mill, run off a condemned electric motor\u2014condemned by him. He tried his hand at fish-farming in a pond at the edge of one of his master\u2019s fields. He bought broken radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not demur even when asked to fix watches, although that enterprise did spectacularly badly, and earned him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took apart ever kept time again. K. K. Harouni lived mostly in Lahore and rarely visited his farms. Whenever the old man did visit, Nawab would place himself night and day at the door leading from the servants\u2019 sitting area into the walled grove of ancient banyan trees where the old farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the household machinery, the air-conditioners, water heaters, refrigerators, and pumps, like an engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts, he almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in Lahore. Harouni, of course, became familiar with this ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on his tours of inspection but could be found morning and night standing on the master bed rewiring the light fixture or poking at the water heater in the bathroom. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him to go ahead. \u201cSir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have earned these gray hairs\u201d\u2014here he bowed his head to show the gray\u2014\u201cand now I cannot fulfill my duties as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud hunger within than disgrace in the light of day. Release me, I ask you, I beg you.\u201d The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at his nails and waited for the breeze to stop. \u201cWhat is the matter, Nawabdin?\u201d \u201cMatter, sir? Oh, what could be the matter in your service? I have eaten your salt for all my years. But, sir, on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the many injuries I have received when heavy machinery fell on me\u2014I cannot any longer bicycle about like a bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I first had the good fortune to enter your service. I beg you, sir, let me go.\u201d \u201cAnd what is the solution?\u201d Harouni asked, seeing that they had come to the crux. He did not particularly care one way or the other, except that it touched on his comfort\u2014a matter of great interest to him. \u201cWell, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could somehow limp along, at least until I train up some younger man.\u201d The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even managed to extract an allowance for gasoline. The motorcycle increased his status, gave him weight, so that people began calling him Uncle and asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he knew absolutely nothing. He could now range farther, doing much wider business. Best of all, now he could spend every night with his wife, who early in the marriage had begged to live not in Nawab\u2019s quarters in the village but with her family in Firoza, near the only girls\u2019 school in the area. A long straight road ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni lands. The road ran on the bed of an old highway built when these lands lay within a princely state. Some hundred and fifty years ago, one of the princes had ridden that way, going to a wedding or a funeral in this remote district, felt hot, and ordered that rosewood trees be planted to shade the passersby. Within a few hours, he forgot that he had given the order, and in a few dozen years he in turn was forgotten, but these trees still stood, enormous now, some of them dead and looming without bark, white and leafless. Nawab would fly down this road on his new machine, with bags and streamers hanging from every knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump, seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his arrival. Nawab\u2019s day, viewed from the air, would have appeared as aimless as that of a butterfly: to the senior manager\u2019s house in the morning, where he diligently paid his respects, then to one or another of the tube wells, kicking up dust on the unpaved field roads, into the town of Firoza, zooming beneath the rosewoods, a bullet of sound, moseying around town, sneaking away to one of his private interests\u2014to cement a deal to distribute ripening early-season honeydews from his cousin\u2019s vegetable plot, or to count before hatching his half share in a flock of chickens\u2014then back to Nurpur Harouni, and out again. The maps of these days, superimposed, would have made a tangle, but every morning he emerged from the same place, just as the sun came up, and every evening he returned there, tired now, darkened, switching off the bike, rolling it over the wooden threshold of the door leading into the courtyard, the engine ticking as it cooled. Nawab leaned the bike on its kickstand each evening and waited for his girls to come, all of them, around him, jumping on him. His face at this moment often had the same expression\u2014an expression of childish innocent joy, which contrasted strangely and even sadly with the heaviness of his face and its lines and stubble. He would raise his nose and sniff the air to see if he could guess what his wife had cooked for dinner, and then he went in to her, finding her always in the same posture, making him tea, fanning the fire in the hearth. \u201cHello, my love, my chicken piece,\u201d he said tenderly one evening, walking into the dark hut that served as a kitchen, the mud walls black with soot. \u201cWhat is in the pot for me?\u201d He opened the cauldron, which had been displaced by the kettle onto the beaten-earth floor, and began to search around in it with a wooden spoon. \u201cOut! Out!\u201d she said, taking the spoon and, dipping it into the curry, giving him a taste. He opened his mouth obediently, like a boy receiving medicine. The wife, despite having borne thirteen children, had a lithe strong body, her vertebrae visible beneath her tight tunic. Her long mannish face still glowed from beneath the skin, giving her a ripe ochre coloring. Even now that her hair was thin and graying, she wore it in a single long braid down to her waist, like a young woman in the village. Although this style did not suit her, Nawab saw in her still the girl he had married twenty years before. He stood in the door, watching his daughters playing hopscotch, and when his wife went past he stuck out his butt, so that she rubbed against it as she squeezed through. Nawab ate first, then the girls, and finally his wife. He sat out in the courtyard, burping and smoking a cigarette, looking up at the crescent moon just visible on the horizon. I wonder what the moon is made of? he thought, without exerting himself. He remembered listening to the radio when the Americans said they had walked on it. His thoughts wandered off onto all sorts of tangents. The dwellers around him in the hamlet had also finished their dinners, and the smoke from cow-dung fires hung over the darkening roofs, a harsh spicy smell, like rough tobacco. Nawab\u2019s house had numerous ingenious contrivances\u2014running water in all three rooms, a duct that brought cool air into the rooms at night, and even a black-and-white television, which his wife covered with a doily that she had embroidered with flowers. Nawab had constructed a gear mechanism so that the antenna on the roof could be turned from inside the house to improve reception. The children sat inside watching it, with the sound blaring. His wife came out and sat primly at his feet on the sagging ropes of the woven bed, swinging her legs. \u201cI have got something in my pocket\u2014would you like to know what?\u201d He looked at her with a pouting sort of smile. \u201cI know this game,\u201d she said, reaching up and straightening his glasses on his face. \u201cWhy are your glasses always crooked? I think one ear\u2019s higher than the other.\u201d \u201cIf you find it, you can have it.\u201d Looking to see that the children were still absorbed in the television, she kneeled next to him and began patting his pockets. \u201cLower . . . lower . . . ,\u201d he said. In the pocket of the greasy vest that he wore under his kurta she found a wrapped-up newspaper holding chunks of raw brown sugar. \u201cI have got lots more,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at that. None of this junk you buy in the bazaar. The Dashtis gave me five kilos for repairing their sugarcane press. I will sell it tomorrow. Make us some parathas. For all of us? Pretty please?\u201d \u201cI put out the fire.\u201d \u201cSo light it. Or, rather, you just sit here\u2014I will light it.\u201d \u201cYou can never light it. I will end up doing it anyway,\u201d she said, getting up. The smaller children, smelling the ghee cooking on the griddle, crowded around, watching the brown sugar melt, and finally even the older girls came in, though they stood haughtily to one side. Nawab, squatting and huffing on the fire, gestured to them. \u201cCome on, you princesses, none of your tricks. I know you want some.\u201d They began eating, pouring the brown crystallized syrup onto pieces of fried bread, and after a while Nawab went to his motorcycle and pulled from the panniers another hunk of the sugar, challenging the girls to see who would eat most. One evening a few weeks after his family\u2019s little festival of sugar, Nawab was sitting with the watchman who kept guard over the grain stores at Nurpur Harouni. A banyan planted alongside the threshing floor only thirty years ago had grown a canopy of forty or fifty feet, and all the men who worked in the stores tended it carefully, watering it with cans. The old watchman sat under this tree, and Nawab and the other younger men would sit with him at dusk, teasing him, trying to make his violent temper flare up, and joking around with one another. They would listen to the old man\u2019s stories, of the time when only dirt tracks led through these riverine tracts and the tribes stole cattle for sport, and often killed each other while doing it, to add piquancy. Although spring weather had come, the watchman still kept a fire burning in a tin pan to warm his feet and to give a center to the group that gathered there. The electricity had failed, as it often did, and the full moon climbing the sky lit the scene indirectly, reflecting off the whitewashed walls, throwing dim shadows around the machinery strewn about, plows and planters, drags, harrows. \u201cHere it is, old man,\u201d Nawab said to the watchman. \u201cI will tie you up and lock you in the stores to make it look like a robbery, and then I will top off my tank at the gas barrel.\u201d \u201cNothing in it for me,\u201d the watchman said. \u201cGo on, I think I hear your wife calling you.\u201d \u201cI understand, sire. You wish to be alone.\u201d Nawab jumped up and shook the watchman\u2019s hand, making a bow, touching his hands deferentially to the old man\u2019s knee, as he would to the feudal K. K. Harouni\u2014a running joke, lost on the watchman these last ten years. \u201cBe careful, boy,\u201d the watchman said, standing up and leaning on his bamboo staff, clad in steel at the tip. Nawab leapt on the kick-starter of his motorcycle, and in one smooth motion flicked on the lights and shot out of the threshing-floor gates, onto the quarter-mile driveway leading from the heart of the farm to the road. He felt cold and liked it, knowing that at home the room would be baking, the two-bar heater running day and night on pilfered electricity, the family luxuriating in excess warmth, even though the spring weather had come. Turning onto the dark main road, he sped up, outrunning the weak headlight, obstacles appearing faster than he could react, feeling as if he were racing forward in the flame of a moving lantern. Nightjars perching on the road as they hunted moths ricocheted into the dark, almost under his wheel. Nawab locked his arms, fighting the bike as he flew over potholes, enjoying the pace, standing on the pegs. Among low-lying fields, where the sugarcane had been heavily watered, mist rose and cool air enveloped him. He slowed, turning onto the smaller road running beside the canal, hearing the water rushing over the locks of the headworks. A man stepped from beside one of the locks, waving down at the ground, motioning Nawab to stop. \u201cBrother,\u201d the man said, over the puttering engine, \u201cgive me a ride into town. I have got business, and I am late.\u201d Strange business at this time of night, Nawab thought, the tail-light of the motorcycle casting a reddish glow around them on the ground. They were far from any dwellings. A mile away, the village of Dashtian crouched beside the road\u2014before that there was nothing. He looked into the man\u2019s face. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d The man looked straight back at him, his face pinched and therefore overstated, but unflinching. \u201cFrom Kashmor. Please, you are the first person to come by for over an hour. I have walked all day.\u201d Kashmor, Nawab thought. From the poor country across the river. Every year, those tribes came to pick the mangoes at Nurpur Harouni and other nearby farms, working for almost nothing, let go as soon as the harvest thinned. The men would give a feast, a thin feast, at the end of the season, a hundred or more going shares to buy a buffalo. Nawab had been several times, and was treated as if he were honoring them, sitting with them and eating the salty rice flecked with bits of meat. He grinned at the man, gesturing with his chin to the seat behind him. \u201cAll right, then, get on the back.\u201d Balancing against the weight behind him, which made driving along the rutted canal road difficult, Nawab pushed on, under the rosewood trees. Half a mile from the headworks, the man shouted into Nawab\u2019s ear, \u201cStop!\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d Nawab could not hear over the rushing wind. The man jabbed something hard into his ribs. \u201cI have got a gun. I will shoot you.\u201d Panicked, Nawab skidded to a stop and jumped to one side, pushing the motorcycle away from him, so that it tipped over, knocking the robber to the ground. The carburetor float hung open, and the engine raced for a minute, the wheel jerking, until the engine sputtered and died, extinguishing the headlight. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nawab babbled. \u201cI will shoot you if you do not stand back,\u201d the robber said, rising up on one knee, the gun pointed at Nawab. They stood obscured in the sudden woolly dark, next to the fallen motorcycle, which leaked raw-smelling gasoline into the dust underfoot. Water running through the reeds in the canal beside them made soft gulping sounds as it swirled along. His eyes adjusting to the dark, Nawab saw the man sucking at a cut on his palm, the gun held in his other hand. When the man went to pick up the bike, Nawab approached a step toward him. \u201cI told you, I will shoot you.\u201d Nawab put his hands together in supplication. \u201cI beg you, I have got little girls, thirteen children. I promise, thirteen. I tried to help you. I will drive you to Firoza, and I will not tell anyone. Do not take the bike\u2014it is my daily bread. I am a man like you, poor as you.\u201d \u201cShut up.\u201d Without thinking, a flash of cunning in his eyes, Nawab lunged for the gun, but missed. For a moment the two men grappled, until the robber broke free, stepped back, and fired. Nawab fell to the ground, holding his groin with both hands, entirely surprised, shocked, as if the man had slapped him for no reason. The man dragged the bike away, straddled it, and tried to start it, bobbing up and down, pitching his weight onto the lever, the engine whirring but not catching. It had flooded, and he held the throttle wide open, which made it worse. At the sound of the shot, the dogs in Dashtian had begun to bark, the sound fitful in the breeze. Lying on the ground, at first Nawab thought the man had killed him. The pale moonlit sky, seen through the branches of the rosewood tree, tilted back and forth like a bowl of swaying water. He had fallen with one leg bent under him, and now he straightened it. His hand came away sticky when he touched the wound. \u201cO God, O Mother, O God,\u201d he moaned, not very loudly, in a singsong voice. He looked at the man, whose back was turned, vulnerable, kicking wildly at the starter, not six feet away. Nawab could not let him take it away\u2014not the bike, his toy, his freedom. He stood up again and stumbled forward, but his injured leg buckled and he fell, his forehead hitting the rear bumper of the motorcycle. Turning in the seat, holding the gun at arm\u2019s length, the robber fired five more times, one two three four five, with Nawab looking up into his face in disbelief, seeing the repeated flame in the revolver\u2019s mouth. The man had never used weapons, had fired this unlicensed revolver only one time, to try it out when he bought it from a bootlegger. He could not bear to point at the torso or the head, but shot at the groin and the legs. The last two bullets missed wildly, throwing up dirt in the road. The robber rolled the motorcycle forward twenty feet, grunting, and again tried to start it. From Dashtian a torch jogged quickly down the road. Throwing the bike to the ground, the man ran into a stand of reeds that bordered a field. Nawab lay in the road, not wanting to move. When the bullets first hit him, they did not so much hurt as sting, but now the pain grew worse. The blood felt warm in his pants. It seemed very peaceful. In the distance, the dogs kept barking, and all around the cicadas called, so many of them that they blended into a single gentle sound. In a mango orchard across the canal, some crows began cawing, and he wondered why they were calling at night. Maybe a snake up in the tree, in the nest. Fresh fish from the spring floods of the Indus had just come onto the market, and he kept remembering that he had wanted to buy some for dinner, perhaps the next night. As the pain grew worse, he thought of that, the smell of frying fish. Two men from the village came running up, one much younger than the other, both of them bare-chested. The elder, potbellied, carried an ancient single-barrelled shotgun, the butt mended crudely with wire. \u201cOh God, they have killed him. Who is it?\u201d The younger man kneeled down next to the body. \u201cIt is Nawab, the electrician, from Nurpur Harouni.\u201d \u201cI am not dead,\u201d Nawab said insistently, without raising his head. He knew these men, a father and son\u2014he had arranged the lighting at the son\u2019s wedding. \u201cThe bastard\u2019s right there in those reeds.\u201d Stepping forward, aiming into the center of the clump, the older man fired, reloaded, and fired again. Nothing moved among the green leafy stalks, which were head high and surmounted by feathers of seed. \u201cHe is gone,\u201d the young man said, sitting next to Nawab, holding his arm. The father walked carefully forward, holding the gun to his shoulder. Something moved, and he fired. The robber fell forward into the open ground. He called, \u201cMother, help me,\u201d and got up on his knees, holding his hands to his waist. Walking up to him, the father hit him once in the middle of the back with the butt of the gun, and then threw down the gun and dragged him roughly by his collar onto the road. Raising the bloody shirt, he saw that the robber had taken half a dozen buckshot pellets in the stomach\u2014black angry holes seeping blood in the light of the torch. The robber kept spitting, without any force. The son got up and started the motorcycle by pushing it down the road with the gears engaged, until the engine came to life. Shouting that he would get some transport, he raced off, and Nawab winced, hearing the man, in his hurry, shifting without using the clutch. \u201cDo you want a cigarette, Uncle?\u201d the old villager said to Nawab, offering the pack. Nawab rolled his head back and forth. \u201cFuck, look at me.\u201d In the silence, a forgotten thought kept bothering Nawab, something important. Then he remembered. \u201cFind the guy\u2019s revolver, Bholay. You are going to need it for the cops.\u201d \u201cI cannot leave you,\u201d he said. But after a minute he threw away his cigarette and got up. The old man was still searching in the reeds when the lights of a pickup materialized at the canal headworks and bounced wildly down the road. The driver, doubtful of the whole affair, stood by while the father and son lifted Nawab and the motorcycle thief into the back. They drove to Firoza, to a private clinic there, run by a mere pharmacist, who nevertheless kept a huge clientele because of his abrupt and sure manner and his success at healing all the prevalent diseases with the same few medicines. The clinic smelled of disinfectant and of bodily fluids, a heavy sweetish odor. Four beds stood in a room, dimly lit by a fluorescent tube. As the father and son carried him in, Nawab, alert to the point of strain, observed blood on some rumpled sheets, a rusty blot. The pharmacist, who lived above the clinic, had come down wearing a loincloth and undershirt. He seemed perfectly unflustered, if anything slightly cross at having been disturbed. \u201cPut them on those two beds.\u201d \u201cAs salaam aleikum, Dr. Sahib,\u201d said Nawab, who felt as if he were speaking to someone very far away. The pharmacist seemed an immensely grave and important man, and Nawab spoke to him formally. \u201cWhat happened, Nawab?\u201d \u201cHe tried to snatch my motorbike, but I did not let him.\u201d The pharmacist pulled off Nawab\u2019s shalwar, got a rag, and washed away the blood, then poked around quite roughly, while Nawab held the sides of the bed and willed himself not to scream. \u201cYou will live,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a lucky man. The bullets all went low.\u201d \u201cDid it hit . . .\u201d The pharmacist dabbed with the rag. \u201cNot even that, thank God.\u201d The robber must have been hit in the lung, for he kept breathing up blood. \u201cYou will not need to bother taking this one to the police,\u201d the pharmacist said. \u201cHe is a dead man.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d the robber begged, trying to raise himself up. \u201cHave mercy, save me. I am a human being also.\u201d The pharmacist went into the office next door and wrote the names of drugs on a pad, sending the villager\u2019s son to a dispenser in the next street. \u201cWake him and tell him it is Nawabdin the electrician. Tell him I will make sure he gets the money.\u201d Nawab looked over at the robber for the first time. There was blood on his pillow, and he kept snuffling, as if he needed to blow his nose. His thin and very long neck hung crookedly on his shoulder, as if out of joint. He was older than Nawab had thought, not a boy, dark-skinned, with sunken eyes and protruding yellow smoker\u2019s teeth, which showed whenever he twitched for breath. \u201cI did you wrong,\u201d the robber said weakly. \u201cI know that. You do not know my life, just as I do not know yours. Even I do not know what brought me here. Maybe you are a poor man, but I am much poorer than you. My mother is old and blind, in the slums outside Multan. Make them fix me, ask them to and they will do it.\u201d He began to cry, not wiping away the tears, which drew lines on his dark face. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d Nawab said, turning away. \u201cMen like you are good at confessions. My children would have begged in the streets.\u201d The robber lay heaving, moving his fingers by his sides. The pharmacist seemed to have gone away somewhere. \u201cThey just said that I am dying. Forgive me for what I did. I was brought up with kicks and slaps and never enough to eat. I have never had anything of my own, no land, no house, no wife, no money, never, nothing. I slept for years on the railway-station platform in Multan. My mother\u2019s blessing on you. Give me your blessing, do not let me die unforgiven.\u201d He began snuffling and coughing even more, and then started hiccupping. Now the disinfectant smelled strong and good to Nawab. The floor seemed to shine. The world around him expanded. \u201cNever. I will not forgive you. You had your life, I had mine. At every step of the road I went the right way and you the wrong. Look at you now, with bubbles of blood stuck in the corner of your lips. Do you think this is not a judgment? My wife and children would have wept all their lives, and you would have sold my motorbike to pay for six unlucky hands of cards and a few bottles of poison home brew. If you were not lying here now, you would already be in one of the gambling camps along the river.\u201d The man said, \u201cPlease, please, please,\u201d more softly each time, and then he stared up at the ceiling. \u201cIt is not true,\u201d he whispered. After a few minutes, he convulsed and died. The pharmacist, who had come back in by then and was cleaning Nawab\u2019s wounds, did nothing to help him. Yet Nawab\u2019s mind caught at this, at the man\u2019s words and his death, like a bird hopping around some bright object, meaning to peck at it. And then he did not. He thought of the motorcycle, saved, and the glory of saving it. Six shots, six coins thrown down, six chances, and not one of them had killed him, not Nawabdin Electrician.",
    "TheBridegroom": "Before Beina\u2019s father died, I promised him that I would take care of his daughter. He and I had been close friends for twenty years. He left his only child with me because my wife and I had no chil- dren of our own. It was easy to keep my word when Beina was still a teenager. As she grew older, it became more dif\ufb01cult, not because she was willful or troublesome, but because no man was interested in her, a short, homely girl. When she turned twenty- three and still had no boyfriend, I began to worry. Where could I \ufb01nd her a husband? Timid and quiet, she did not know how to get close to a man. I was afraid she would end up an old maid. Then, out of the blue, Huang Baowen proposed to her. I found myself at a loss, because they would hardly known each other. How could he be serious about his offer? I feared he might make a fool of Beina, so I insisted they get engaged if he meant busi- ness. He came to my home with two trussed-up capons, four car- tons of Ginseng cigarettes, two bottles of Five Grains\u2019 Sap, and one tall tin of oolong tea. I was pleased, though not very i am- pressed by his gifts. Two months later they got married. My colleagues congratu- lated me, saying, \u201cThat was fast, Old Cheng.\u201d What a relief to me. But to many young women in our sewing machine factory, Beina\u2019s marriage was a slap in the face. They would say, \u201cA hen cooped up a peacock.\u201d Or, \u201cA fool always lands in the arms of fortune.\u201d True, Baowen had been one of the most hand- some unmarried men in the factory, and nobody had expected that Beina, stocky and stout, would win him. What is more, Baowen was good-natured and well educated\u2014a middle school graduate\u2014and he did not smoke or drink or gamble. He had \ufb01ne manners and often smiled politely, showing his bright, straight teeth. In a way he resembled a woman, delicate, clear-skinned, and soft-spoken; he even could knit things out of wool. But no men dared bully him because he was skilled at martial arts. Three times in a row he had won the \ufb01rst prize for kung fu at our factory\u2019s annual sports meet. He was very good at the long sword and freestyle boxing. When he was in middle school, bigger boys had often picked on him, so his stepfather had sent him to the martial arts school in their hometown. A year later, nobody would bug him again. Sometimes I could not help wondering why Baowen had fallen for Beina. What in her had caught his heart? Did he really like her \ufb02eshy face, which often reminded me of a blow\ufb01sh? Al- though we had our doubts, my wife and I could not say anything negative about the marriage. Our only concern was that Baowen might be too good for our adopted daughter. Whenever I heard that somebody had divorced, I would feel a sudden \ufb02utter of panic. 92 As the head of the Security Section in the factory, I had some pull and did what I could to help the young couple. Soon after their wedding, I secured them a brand-new two-bedroom apart- ment, which angered some people waiting in line for housing. I was not daunted by their criticism. I would do almost anything to make Beina\u2019s marriage a success, because I believed that if it survived the \ufb01rst two years, it might last decades\u2014once Baowen became a father, it would be dif\ufb01cult for him to break loose. But after they would been married for eight months, Beina still was not pregnant. I was afraid that Baowen would soon grow tired of her and run after another woman, as many young women in the factory were still attracted to him. A brazen one even declared she would leave her door open for him all night long. Some of them frequently offered him movie tickets and meat coupons. It seemed that they were determined to wreck Beina\u2019s marriage. I hated them, and just the thought of them would give me an earache or a sour stomach. Fortunately, Baowen had not yet done anything out- side the bounds of a decent husband. One morning in early November, Beina stepped into my of- \ufb01ce. \u201cUncle,\u201d she said in a tearful voice, \u201cBaowen did not come home last night.\u201d I tried to remain calm, though my head began to swim. \u201cDo you know where he is been?\u201d I asked. \u201cI do not know. I looked for him everywhere.\u201d She licked her cracked lips and took off her green work cap, her hair in a huge bun. \u201cWhen did you see him last?\u201d \u201cAt dinner yesterday evening. He said he was going to see somebody. He has lots of buddies in town.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d I did not know he had many friends. \u201cDo not worry. Go back to your workshop and do not tell anybody about this. I will call around and \ufb01nd him.\u201d She dragged herself out of my of\ufb01ce. She must have gained at least a dozen pounds since the wedding. Her blue dungarees had become so tight that they seemed about to burst. Viewed from be- hind, she looked like a giant turnip. I called the Rainbow Movie Theater, Victory Park, and a few restaurants in town. They all said they had not seen anyone matching Baowen\u2019s description. Before I could phone the City Library where Baowen sometimes spent much of his weekends, a call came in. It was from the city\u2019s Public Security Bureau. The man on the phone said they would detained a worker of ours, named Huang Baowen. He would not tell me what had happened. He just said, \u201cIndecent activity. Come as soon as you can.\u201d It was a cold day. As I cycled toward downtown, the shrill north wind kept \ufb02ipping up the front ends of my overcoat. My knees were sore, and I could not help shivering. Soon my asthma tight- ened my throat and I began moaning. I could not stop cursing Baowen. \u201cI knew it. I just knew it,\u201d I said to myself. I had sensed that sooner or later he would seek pleasure with another woman. Now he was in the hands of the police, and the whole factory would talk about him. How would Beina take this blow? At the Public Security Bureau I was surprised to see that about a dozen of\ufb01cials from other factories, schools, and compa- nies were already there. I knew most of them\u2014they were in charge of security affairs at their workplaces. A policewoman conducted us into a conference room upstairs where green silk curtains hung in the windows. We sat down around a long ma- hogany table and waited to be briefed about the case. The glass tabletop was brand-new, its edge still sharp. I saw worry and con- fusion on the other men\u2019s faces. I \ufb01gured Baowen must have been involved in a major crime\u2014either an orgy or a gang rape. On second thought, I was sure he could not have been a rapist; by na- 94 ture he was kindhearted, very gentle. I hoped this was not a po- litical case, which would be absolutely unpardonable. Six or seven years ago, a half-wit and a high school graduate had started an association in our city, named the China Liberation Party, which eventually recruited nine members. Although the sparrow is small, it has a complete set of organs\u2014their party elected a chairman, a secretary, and even a prime minister. But before they could print their manifesto, which expressed their intention to overthrow the government, the police rounded them up. Two of the top leaders were executed, and the rest of the members were jailed. As I was wondering about the nature of Baowen\u2019s crime, a middle-aged man came in. He had a solemn face, and his eyes were half-closed. He took off his dark-blue tunic, hung it on the back of a chair, and sat down at the end of the table. I recog- nized him; he was Chief Miao of the Investigation Department. Wearing a sheepskin jerkin, he somehow reminded me of Gen- ghis Khan, thick-boned and round-faced. His hooded eyes were shrewd, though they looked sleepy. Without any opening re- marks he declared that we had a case of homosexuality on our hands. At that, the room turned noisy. We would heard that term be- fore but did not know what it meant exactly. Seeing many of us puzzled, Chief Miao explained, \u201cIt is a social disease, like gam- bling, or prostitution, or syphilis.\u201d He kept on squirming as if itchy with hemorrhoids. A young man from the city\u2019s Fifth Middle School raised his hand. He asked, \u201cWhat do homosexuals do?\u201d Miao smiled and his eyes almost disappeared. He said, \u201cPeople of the same sex have a sexual relationship.\u201d \u201cSodomy!\u201d cried someone. The room turned quiet for at least ten seconds. Then some- body asked what kind of crime this was. 95 Chief Miao explained, \u201cHomosexuality originated in Western capitalism and bourgeois lifestyle. According to our law it is dealt with as a kind of hooliganism. Therefore, every one of the men we arrested will serve a sentence, from six months to \ufb01ve years, depending on the severity of his crime and his attitude toward it.\u201d A truck blew its horn on the street and made my heart twinge. If Baowen went to prison, Beina would live like a widow, unless she divorced him. Why had he married her to begin with? Why did he ruin her this way? What had happened was that a group of men, mostly clerks, artists, and schoolteachers, had formed a club called Men\u2019s World, a salon of sorts. Every Thursday evening they would meet in a large room on the third \ufb02oor of the of\ufb01ce building of the Forestry Institute. Since the club admitted only men, the police suspected that it might be a secret association with a leaning toward vio- lence, so they assigned two detectives to mix with the group. True, some of the men appeared to be intimate with one another in the club, but most of the time they talked about movies, books, and current events. Occasionally music was played, and they danced together. According to the detectives\u2019 account, it was a bizarre, emotional scene. A few men appeared in pairs, un- ashamed of necking and cuddling in the presence of others, and some would say with tears, \u201cAt last we men have a place for our- selves.\u201d A middle-aged painter wearing earrings exclaimed, \u201cNow I feel alive! Only in here can I stop living in hypocrisy.\u201d Every week, two or three new faces would show up. When the club grew close to thirty men, the police took action and arrested them all. After Chief Miao\u2019s brie\ufb01ng, we were allowed to meet with the criminals for \ufb01fteen minutes. A policeman led me into a small room in the basement and let me read Baowen\u2019s confession while he went to fetch him. I glanced through the four pages of interro- 96 gation notes, which stated that Baowen had been new to the club, and that he would joined them only twice, mainly because he was in- terested in their talks. Yet he did not deny he was a homosexual. As it was next to a bathroom, the room smelled of urine. The policeman brought Baowen in and ordered him to sit opposite me at the table. Baowen, in handcuffs, avoided looking at me. His face was bloated, covered with bruises. A broad welt left by a baton, about four inches long, slanted across his forehead. The collar of his jacket was torn open. Yet he did not appear fright- ened. His calm manner angered me, though I felt sorry for him. I kept a hard face and said, \u201cBaowen, do you know you com- mitted a crime?\u201d \u201cI did not do anything. I just went there to listen to them talk.\u201d \u201cYou mean you did not do that thing with any man?\u201d I wanted to make sure, so that I could help him. He looked at me, then lowered his eyes, saying, \u201cI would thought about doing something, but, to be honest, I did not.\u201d \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d \u201cI\u2014I liked a man in the club, a lot. If he would asked me, I might have agreed.\u201d His lips curled upward as if he prided himself on what he had said. \u201cYou are sick!\u201d I struck the table with my knuckles. To my surprise, he said, \u201cSo? I am a sick man. You think I do not know that?\u201d I was bewildered. He went on, \u201cYears ago I tried everything to cure myself. I took a lot of herbs and boluses, and even ate baked scorpions, lizards, and toads. Nothing helped me. Still I am fond of men. I do not know why I am not interested in women. Whenever I am with a woman my heart is as calm as a stone.\u201d Outraged by his confession, I asked, \u201cThen why did you marry my Beina? To make fun of her, eh? To throw mud in my face?\u201d 97 \u201cHow could I be that mean? Before we got married, I told her I did not like women and might not give her a baby.\u201d \u201cShe believed you?\u201d \u201cYes. She said she would not mind. She just wanted a husband, a home.\u201d \u201cShe is an idiot!\u201d I unfolded my hanky and blew my clogged nose into it, then asked, \u201cWhy did you choose her if you had no feelings for her at all?\u201d \u201cWhat was the difference? For me she was similar to other women.\u201d \u201cYou are a scoundrel!\u201d \u201cIf I did not marry her, who would? The marriage helped us both, covering me and saving face for her. Besides, we could have a good apartment\u2014a home. You see, I tried living like a normal man. I have never been mean to Beina.\u201d \u201cBut the marriage is a fake! You lied to your mother too, did not you?\u201d \u201cShe wanted me to marry.\u201d The policeman signaled that our meeting was over. In spite of my anger, I told Baowen that I would see what I could do, and that he would better cooperate with the police and show a sincere attitude. What should I do? I was sick of him, but he belonged to my family, at least in name, and I was obligated to help him. On the way home I pedaled slowly, my mind heavy with thoughts. Gradually I realized that I might be able to do some- thing to prevent him from going to jail. There were two steps I must take: \ufb01rst, I would maintain that he had done nothing in the club, so as to isolate him from the real criminals; second, I would present him as a sick man, so that he might receive med- ical treatment instead of a prison term. Once he became a crimi- nal, he would be marked forever as an enemy of society, no longer redeemable. Even his children would suffer. I ought to save him. 98 Fortunately both the Party secretary and the director of our fac- tory were willing to accept Baowen as a sick man, particularly Secretary Zhu, who liked Baowen\u2019s kung fu style and had once let him teach his youngest son how to use a three-section cudgel. Zhu suggested we make an effort to rescue Baowen from the po- lice. In the men\u2019s room inside our of\ufb01ce building, he said to me, \u201cOld Cheng, we must not let Baowen end up in prison.\u201d I was grateful for his words. All of a sudden homosexuality became a popular topic in the factory. A few old workers said that some actors of the Beijing Opera had slept together as lovers in the old days, because no women were allowed to perform in any troupe and the actors could associate only with other men. Secretary Zhu, who was well read, said that some emperors in the Han Dynasty had kept male lovers in addition to their large harems. Director Liu had heard that the last emperor, Puyi, had often ordered his eunuchs to suck his penis and caress his testicles. Someone even claimed that homosexuality was an upper-class thing, not something for ordinary people. All this talk sickened me. I felt ashamed of my so-called son-in-law. I would not join them in talking, and just lis- tened, pretending I was not bothered. As I expected, rumors ran wild in the factory, especially in the foundry shop. Some people said Baowen was impotent. Some be- lieved he was a hermaphrodite, otherwise his wife would have been pregnant long ago. To console Beina, I went to see her one evening. She had a pleasant home, in which everything was in order. Two bookcases, \ufb01lled with industrial manuals, biographies, novels, and medical books, stood against the whitewashed wall, on each side of the window. In one corner of the living room was a coat tree on which hung the red down parka Baowen had bought her before 99 their wedding, and in another corner sat a \ufb02oor lamp. At the op- posite end of the room two pots of blooming \ufb02owers, one of cy- clamens and the other of Bengal roses, were placed on a pair of low stools kept at an equal distance from each other and from the walls on both sides. Near the inner wall was a large sofa uphol- stered in orange imitation leather, and next to it, a yellow enamel spittoon. A black-and-white TV perched on an oak chest against the outer wall. I was impressed, especially by the \ufb02oor, inlaid with bricks and coated with bright red paint. Even my wife did not keep a home so neat. No doubt it was Baowen\u2019s work, because Beina could not be so tidy. Already the room showed the trace of her sloppy habits\u2014 in a corner were scattered an empty \ufb02our sack and a pile of soiled laundry. Sipping the tea she had poured me, I said, \u201cBeina, I am sorry about Baowen. I did not know he was so bad.\u201d \u201cNo, he is a good man.\u201d Her round eyes looked at me with a steady light. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d \u201cHe is been good to me.\u201d \u201cBut he cannot be a good husband, can he?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said bluntly, \u201cHe did not go to bed with you very often, did he?\u201d \u201cOh, he cannot do that because he practices kung fu. He said if he slept with a woman, all his many years\u2019 work would be gone. From the every beginning his master told him to avoid women.\u201d \u201cSo you do not mind?\u201d I was puzzled, saying to myself, What a stupid girl. \u201cNot really.\u201d \u201cBut you two must have shared the bed a couple of times, have not you?\u201d \u201cNo, we have not.\u201d \u201cReally? Not even once?\u201d 100 \u201cNo.\u201d She blushed a little and looked away, twisting her ear- lobe with her \ufb01ngertips. My head was reeling. After eight months\u2019 marriage she was still a virgin! And she did not mind! I lifted the cup and took a large gulp of the jasmine tea. A lull settled in. We both turned to watch the evening news; my numb mind could not take in what the anchorwoman was say- ing about a border skirmish between Vietnamese and Chinese troops. A moment later I told Beina, \u201cI am sorry he has such a prob- lem. If only we had known.\u201d \u201cDo not feel so bad, Uncle. In fact he is better than a normal man.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d \u201cMost men cannot stay away from pretty women, but Baowen just likes to have a few buddies. What is wrong with that? It is bet- ter this way, because I do not have to worry about those shameless bitches in our factory. He does not bother to give them a look. He will never have a lifestyle problem.\u201d I almost laughed, wondering how I should explain to her that he could have a sexual relationship with a man and that he would been detained precisely because of a lifestyle problem. On second thought, I realized it might be better for her to continue to think that way. She did not need more stress at the moment. Then we talked about how to help Baowen. I told her to write a report emphasizing what a good, considerate husband he would been. Of course she must not mention his celibacy in their mar- riage. Also, from now on, however vicious her fellow workers\u2019 remarks were, she should merely ignore them and never talk back, as if she would heard nothing. That night when I told my wife about Beina\u2019s silly notions, she smiled, saying, \u201cCompared to most men, Baowen is not so bad. Beina\u2019s not a fool.\u201d 101 I begged Chief Miao and a higher-ranking of\ufb01cer to treat Baowen leniently and even gave each of them two bottles of brandy and a coupon for a Butter\ufb02y sewing machine. They seemed willing to help, but would not promise me anything. For days I was so anx- ious that my wife was afraid my ulcer might recur. One morning the Public Security Bureau called, saying they had accepted our factory\u2019s proposal and would have Baowen transferred to the mental hospital in a western suburb, provided our factory agreed to pay for his hospitalization. I accepted the offer readily, feeling relieved. Later, I learned that there was not enough space in the city\u2019s prison for twenty-seven gay men, who could not be mixed with other inmates and had to be put in soli- tary cells. So only four of them were jailed; the rest were either hospitalized (if their work units agreed to pay their medical ex- penses) or sent to some labor farms to be reformed. The two Party members among them did not go to jail, though they were expelled from the Party, a very severe punishment that ended their political lives. The moment I put down the phone, I hurried to the assembly shop and found Beina. She broke into tears at the good news. She ran back home and \ufb01lled a duffel bag with Baowen\u2019s clothes. We met at my of\ufb01ce, then together set out for the Public Security Bu- reau. I pedaled my bicycle and she sat behind me, embracing the duffel as if it were a baby. With a strong tailwind, the cycling was easy and fast, so we arrived before Baowen left for the hospital. He was waiting for a van in front of the police station, accompa- nied by two policemen. The bruises on his face had healed, and he looked handsome again. He smiled at us and said rather secretively, \u201cI want to ask you a favor.\u201d He rolled his eyes as the dark-green van rounded the street corner, coming toward us. 102 \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cDo not let my mother know the truth. She is too old to take it. Do not tell her, please!\u201d \u201cWhat should we say to her, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cJust say I have a temporary mental disorder.\u201d Beina could not hold back her tears anymore, saying loudly, \u201cDo not worry. We will not let her know. Take care of yourself and come back soon.\u201d She handed him the duffel, which he accepted without a word. I nodded to assure him that I would not reveal the truth. He smiled at her, then at me. For some reason his face turned rather sweet\u2014charming and enticing, as though it were a mysterious female face. I blinked my eyes and wondered if he was really a man. It \ufb02ashed through my mind that if he were a woman, he would have been quite a beauty\u2014tall, slim, muscular, and slightly languid. My thoughts were cut short by a metallic screech as the van stopped in front of us. Baowen climbed into it; so did the police- men. I walked around the van and shook his hand, saying that I would visit him the next week, and that meanwhile, if he needed anything, just to give me a ring. We waved goodbye as the van drew away, its tire chains clat- tering and \ufb02inging up bits of snow. After a blasting toot, it turned left and disappeared from the icy street. I got on my bicycle as a gust of wind blew up and almost threw me down. Beina followed me for about twenty yards, then leaped on the carrier, and to- gether we headed home. She was so heavy. Thank heaven, I was riding a Great Golden Deer, one of the sturdiest makes. During the following week I heard from Baowen once. He said on the phone that he felt better now and less agitated. Indeed his voice sounded calm and smooth. He asked me to bring him a few books when I came, speci\ufb01cally his Dictionary of Universal Knowl- 103 edge, which was a hefty, rare book translated from the Russian in the late \ufb01fties. I had no idea how he had come by it. I went to see him on Thursday morning. The hospital was on a mountain, six miles southwest of Muji City. As I was cycling on the asphalt road, a few tall smokestacks fumed lazily beyond the larch woods in the west. To my right, the power lines along the roadside curved, heavy with \ufb02uffy snow, which would drop in little chunks whenever the wind blew across them. Now and then I overtook a horse cart loaded with earless sheaves of wheat, followed by one or two foals. After I pedaled across a stone bridge and turned in to the mouth of a valley, a group of brick buildings emerged on a gentle slope, connected to one another by straight cement paths. Farther up the hill, past the buildings, there was a cow pen, in which about two dozen milk cows were grazing on dry grass while a few others huddled together to keep warm. It was so peaceful here that if you had not known this was a mental hospital, you might have imagined it was a sanatorium for ranking of\ufb01cials. Entering Building 9, I was stopped by a guard, who then took me to Baowen\u2019s room on the ground \ufb02oor. It happened that the doctor on duty, a tall fortyish man with ta- pering \ufb01ngers, was making the morning rounds and examining Baowen. He shook hands with me and said that my son-in-law was doing \ufb01ne. His surname was Mai; his whiskered face looked very intelligent. When he turned to give a male nurse instruc- tions about Baowen\u2019s treatment, I noticed an enormous wart in his ear, almost blocking the earhole like a hearing aid. In a way he looked like a foreigner. I wondered if he had some Mongolian or Tibetan blood. \u201cWe give him the electric bath,\u201d Dr. Mai said to me a moment later. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, wincing. \u201cWe treat him with the electric bath.\u201d 104 I turned to Baowen. \u201cHow is it?\u201d \u201cIt is good, really soothing.\u201d He smiled, but there was a churl- ish look in his eyes, and his mouth tightened. The nurse was ready to take him for the treatment. Never having heard of such a bath, I asked Dr. Mai, \u201cCan I see how it works?\u201d \u201cAll right, you may go with them.\u201d Together we climbed the stairs to the second \ufb02oor. There was another reason for me to join them. I wanted to \ufb01nd out whether Baowen was a normal man. The rumors in our factory had got- ten on my nerves, particularly the one that said he had no penis\u2014 that was why he had always avoided bathing in the workers\u2019 bathhouse. After taking off our shoes and putting on plastic slippers, we entered a small room that had pea-green walls and a parquet \ufb02oor. At its center lay a porcelain bathtub, a ghastly thing, like an instrument of torture. Af\ufb01xed along the interior wall of the tub were rectangles of black, perforated metal. Three thick rubber cords connected them to a tall machine standing by the wall. A control board full of buttons, gauges, and switches was mounted atop the machine. The young nurse, burly and square-faced, turned on the faucet; steaming water began to tumble into the tub. Then he went over to operate the machine. He seemed good-natured; his name was Long Fuhai. He said he came from the countryside, apparently of peasant stock, and had graduated from Jilin Nursing School. Baowen smiled at me while unbuttoning his zebra-striped hospital robe. He looked \ufb01ne now\u2014all the bruises had disap- peared from his face, which had become pinkish and smooth. I was frightened by the tub, however. It seemed more suitable for electrocuting a criminal. No matter how sick I might be, I would never lie in it with my back resting against that metal groove. What if there were a problem with the wiring? 105 \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I asked Baowen. \u201cNo.\u201d He went behind a khaki screen in a corner and began taking off his clothes. When the water half \ufb01lled the tub, the nurse took a small bag of white powder out of a drawer, cut it open with scis- sors, and poured the stuff into the water. It must be salt. He tucked up his shirt sleeves and bent double to agitate the solution with both hands, which were large and sinewy. To my dismay, Baowen came out in a clean pair of shorts. Without hesitation he got into the tub and lay down, just as one would enter a lukewarm bathing pool. I was amazed. \u201cHave you given him electricity yet?\u201d I asked Nurse Long. \u201cYes, some. I will increase it little by little.\u201d He turned to the ma- chine and adjusted a few buttons. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said to me, \u201cyour son-in-law is a very good patient, always cooperative.\u201d \u201cHe should be.\u201d \u201cThat is why we give him the bath. Other patients get electric cuffs around their limbs or electric rods on their bodies. Some of them scream like animals every time. We have to tie them up.\u201d \u201cWhen will he be cured?\u201d \u201cI am not sure.\u201d Baowen was noiseless in the electri\ufb01ed water, with his eyes shut and his head resting on a black rubber pad at the end of the tub. He looked \ufb01ne, rather relaxed. I drew up a chair and sat down. Baowen seemed reluctant to talk, preferring to concentrate on the treatment, so I remained silent, observing him. His body was wiry, his legs hairless, and the front of his shorts bulged quite a bit. He looked all right physically. Once in a while he breathed a feeble sigh. As the nurse increased the electric current, Baowen began to squirm in the tub as if smarting from something. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked but dared not touch him. 106 \u201cYeah.\u201d He kept his eyes shut. Glistening beads of sweat gathered on his forehead. He looked pale, his lips curling now and again as though he were thirsty. Then the nurse gave him more electricity. Baowen began writhing and moaning a little. Obviously he was suffering. This bath could not be so soothing as he would claimed. With a white towel Nurse Long wiped the sweat off Baowen\u2019s face and whispered, \u201cI will turn it down in a few minutes.\u201d \u201cNo, give me more!\u201d Baowen said resolutely without opening his eyes, his face twisted. I felt as though he were ashamed of himself. Perhaps my pres- ence made this section of the treatment more uncomfortable for him. His hands gripped the rim of the tub, his arched wrists trembling. For a good three minutes nobody said a word; the room was so quiet that its walls seemed to be ringing. As the nurse gradually reduced the electricity, Baowen calmed down. His toes stopped wiggling. Not wanting to bother him further with my presence, I went out to look for Doctor Mai, to thank him and \ufb01nd out when Baowen would be cured. The doctor was not in his of\ufb01ce, so I walked out of the building for a breath of air. The sun was high and the snow blazingly white. Once outside, I had to close my eyes for a minute to adjust them. I then sat down on a bench and lit a cigarette. A young woman in an ermine hat and army mit- tens passed by, holding an empty milk pail and humming the song \u201cComrade, Please Have a Cup of Tea.\u201d She looked hand- some, and her crisp voice pleased me. I gazed at the pair of thick braids behind her, which swayed a little in the wind. My heart was full of pity for Baowen. He was such a \ufb01ne young man that he ought to be able to love a woman, have a fam- ily, and enjoy a normal life. Twenty minutes later I rejoined him in his room. He looked 107 tired, still shivering a little. He told me that as the electric cur- rents increased, his skin had begun prickling as though stung by hundreds of mosquitoes. That was why he could not stay in the tub for longer than half an hour. I felt for him and said, \u201cI will tell our leaders how sincere your attitude is and how cooperative you are.\u201d \u201cOh, \ufb01ne.\u201d He tilted his damp head. \u201cThanks for bringing the books.\u201d \u201cDo you need something else?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He sounded sad. \u201cBaowen, I hope you can come home before the New Year. Beina needs you.\u201d \u201cI know. I do not want to be locked up here forever.\u201d I told him that Beina had written to his mother, saying he would been away on a business trip. Then the bell for lunch rang in the building, and outside the loudspeaker began broadcasting the \ufb01ery music of \u201cMarch of the Volunteers.\u201d Nurse Long walked in with a pair of chopsticks and a plate containing two corn buns. He said cheerily to Baowen, \u201cI will bring you the dish in a minute. We have tofu stewed with sauerkraut today, also bean sprout soup.\u201d I stood up and took my leave. When I reported Baowen\u2019s condition to the factory leaders, they seemed impressed. The term \u201celectric bath\u201d must have given their imagination free rein. Secretary Zhu kept shaking his head and said, \u201cI am sorry Baowen has to go through such a thing.\u201d I did not explain that the electric bath was a treatment less se- vere than the other kinds, nor did I describe what the bath was like. I just said, \u201cThey steep him in electri\ufb01ed water every day.\u201d Let the terror seize their brains, I thought, so that they might be more sympathetic toward Baowen when he is discharged from the hospital. 108 It was mid-December, and Baowen had been in the hospital for a month already. For days Beina went on saying that she wanted to see how her husband was doing; she was eager to bring him home before the New Year. Among her fellow workers rumors persisted. One said the electric bath had blistered Baowen; an- other claimed that his genitals had been shriveled up by the treat- ment; another added that he had become a vegetarian, nauseated at the mere sight of meat. The young woman who had once de- clared she would leave her door open for him had just married and proudly told everybody she was pregnant. People began to be kind and considerate to Beina, treating her like an abused wife. The leaders of the assembly shop assigned her only the daytime shift. I was pleased that Finance still paid Baowen his wages as though he were on sick leave. Perhaps they did this because they did not want to upset me. On Saturday, Beina and I went to the mental hospital. She could not pedal, and it was too far for me to carry her on my bicy- cle, so we took the bus. She had been there by herself two weeks ago to deliver some socks and a pair of woolen pajamas she would knitted for Baowen. We arrived at the hospital early in the afternoon. Baowen looked healthy and in good spirits. It seemed the bath had helped him. He was happy to see Beina and even cuddled her in my presence. He gave her two toffees; knowing I disliked candies, he did not offer any to me. He poured a large mug of malted milk for both of us, since there was only one mug in the room. I did not touch the milk, unsure whether homosexuality was communica- ble. I was glad to see that he treated his wife well. He took a gen- uine interest in what she said about their comrades in our factory, and now and then laughed heartily. What a wonderful husband he could have been if he were not sick. 109 Having sat with the couple for a few minutes, I left so that they could be alone. I went to the nurses\u2019 of\ufb01ce upstairs and found Long Fuhai writing at a desk. The door was open, and I knocked on its frame. Startled, he closed his brown notebook and stood up. \u201cI did not mean to scare you,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, Uncle, only because I did not expect anyone to come up here.\u201d I took a carton of Peony cigarettes out of my bag and put it on the desk, saying, \u201cI will not take too much of your time, young man. Please keep this as a token of my regards.\u201d I did not mean to bribe him; I was sincerely grateful to him for treating Baowen well. \u201cOh, do not give me this, please.\u201d \u201cYou do not smoke?\u201d \u201cI do. Tell you what, give it to Dr. Mai. He will help Baowen more.\u201d I was puzzled. Why did not he want these top-quality ciga- rettes if he smoked? Seeing that I was confused, he went on, \u201cI will be nice to Baowen without any gift from you. He is a good man. It is the doctor\u2019s wheels that you should grease.\u201d \u201cI have another carton for him.\u201d \u201cOne carton\u2019s nothing here. You should give him at least two.\u201d I was moved by his thoughtfulness, thanked him, and said goodbye. Dr. Mai happened to be in his of\ufb01ce. When I walked in, he was reading the current issue of Women\u2019s Life, whose back cover carried a large photo of Madame Mao on trial\u2014she wore black and stood, handcuffed, between two young policewomen. Dr. Mai put the magazine aside and asked me to sit down. In the room, tall shelves loaded with books and \ufb01les lined the walls. A smell of rotten fruit hung in there. He seemed pleased to see me. 110 After we exchanged a few words, I took out both cartons of cigarettes and handed them to him. \u201cThis is just a small token of my gratitude, for the New Year,\u201d I said. He took the cigarettes and put them away under his desk. \u201cThanks a lot,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDr. Mai, do you think Baowen will be cured before the holi- day?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did you say? Cured?\u201d He looked surprised. \u201cYes.\u201d He shook his head slowly, then turned to check that the door was shut. It was. He motioned me to move closer. I pulled the chair forward a little and rested my forearms on the edge of his Bakelite desktop. \u201cTo be honest, there is no cure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHomosexuality is not an illness, so how can it have a cure? Do not tell anyone I said this.\u201d \u201cThen why torture Baowen like that?\u201d \u201cThe police sent him here and we could not refuse. Besides, we ought to make him feel better and hopeful.\u201d \u201cSo it is not a disease?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, no. Let me say this again: there is no cure for your son-in-law, Old Cheng. It is not a disease. It is just a sexual preference; it may be congenital, like being left-handed. Got it?\u201d \u201cThen why give him the electric bath?\u201d Still I was not con- vinced. \u201cElectrotherapy is prescribed by the book\u2014a standard treat- ment required by the Department of Public Health. I have no choice but to follow the regulations. That is why I did not give him any of those harsher treatments. The bath is very mild by com- parison. You see, I have done everything in my power to help him. Let me tell you another fact: according to the statistics, so far elec- trotherapy has cured only one out of a thousand homosexuals. I 111 bet cod liver oil, or chocolate, or fried pork, anything, could pro- duce a better result. All right, enough of this. I have said too much.\u201d At last his words sank in. For a good while I sat there motion- less with a numb mind. A \ufb02ock of sparrows were \ufb02itting about in the naked branches outside the window, chasing the one that held a tiny ear of millet in its bill. Another of them dragged a yellow string tied around its leg, unable to \ufb02y as nimbly as the others. I rose to my feet and thanked the doctor for his candid words. He stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray on the win- dowsill and said, \u201cI will take special care of your son-in-law. Do not worry.\u201d I rejoined Beina downstairs. Baowen looked quite cheerful, and it seemed they would had a good time. He said to me, \u201cIf I cannot come home soon, do not push too hard to get me out. They will not keep me here forever.\u201d \u201cI will see what I can do.\u201d In my heart I was exasperated, because if Dr. Mai\u2019s words were true, there would be little I could do for Baowen. If homosexual- ity was not a disease, why had he felt sick and tried to have himself cured? Had he been shamming? It was unlikely. Beina had been busy cleaning their home since her last visit to the hospital. She bought two young drakes and planned to make drunk duck, the dish she said Baowen liked best. My heart was heavy. On the one hand, I would have loved to have him back for the holiday; on the other hand, I was unsure what would happen if his condition had not improved. I dared not reveal my thoughts to anybody, not even to my wife, who had a big mouth. Because of her, the whole factory knew that Beina was still a virgin, and some people called her Virgin Bride. For days I pondered what to do. I was confused. Everybody said that homosexuality was a disease except for Dr. Mai, whose opinion I dared not mention to others. The factory leaders would 112 be mad at me if they knew there was no cure for homosexuality. We had already spent over three thousand yuan on Baowen. I kept questioning in my mind, If homosexuality is a natural thing, then why are there men and women? Why cannot two men get married and make a baby? Why did not nature give men another hole? I was beset by doubts. If only I could have seen a trustwor- thy doctor for a second opinion. If only I had a knowledgeable, honest friend to talk with. I had not yet made up my mind about what to do when, \ufb01ve days before the holiday, Chief Miao called from the Public Secu- rity Bureau. He informed me that Baowen had repeated his crime, so the police had taken him out of the hospital and sent him to the prison in Tangyuan County. \u201cThis time he did it,\u201d said the chief. \u201cImpossible!\u201d I cried. \u201cWe have evidence and witnesses. He does not deny it him- self.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I did not know how to continue. \u201cHe has to be incarcerated now.\u201d \u201cAre you sure he is not a hermaphrodite?\u201d I mentioned that as a last resort. Miao chuckled drily. \u201cNo, he is not. We had him checked. Physically he is a man, healthy and normal. Obviously it is a men- tal, moral disease, like an addiction to opium.\u201d Putting down the phone, I felt dizzy, cursing Baowen for having totally ruined himself. What had happened was that he and Long Fuhai had developed a relationship secretly. The nurse often gave him a double amount of meat or \ufb01sh at dinner. Baowen, in return, unraveled his woolen pajamas and knitted Long a pullover with the wool. One evening when they were lying in each other\u2019s arms in the nurses\u2019 of\ufb01ce, an old cleaner passed by in the corridor and coughed. Long Fuhai was terri\ufb01ed, convinced that the man saw what they had been doing. For days, 113 however hard Baowen tried to talk him out of his conviction, Long would not change his mind, blaming Baowen for having misled him. He said that the old cleaner often smiled at him meaningfully and was sure to turn them in. Finally Long Fuhai went to the hospital leaders and confessed everything. So unlike Baowen, who got three and a half years in jail, Nurse Long was merely put on probation; if he worked harder and criticized him- self well, he might keep his current job. That evening I went to tell Beina about the new development. As I spoke, she sobbed continually. Although she would been cleaning the apartment for several days, her home was a shambles, most of the \ufb02owers half dead, and dishes and pots piled in the sink. Mop- ping her face with a pink towel, she asked me, \u201cWhat should I tell my mother-in-law?\u201d \u201cTell her the truth.\u201d She made no response. I said again, \u201cYou should consider a divorce.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Her sobbing turned into wailing. \u201cHe\u2014he is my hus- band and I am his wife. If I die my soul belongs to him. We have sworn never to leave each other. Let others say whatever they want, I know he is a good man.\u201d \u201cThen why did he go to bed with Long Fuhai?\u201d \u201cHe just wanted to have a good time. That was all. It is noth- ing like adultery or bigamy, is it?\u201d \u201cBut it is a crime that got him put in jail,\u201d I said. Although in my heart I admitted that Baowen in every way was a good fellow except for his fondness for men, I had to be adamant about my position. I was in charge of security for our factory; if I had a criminal son-in-law, who would listen to me? Would not I be re- moved from my of\ufb01ce soon? If I lost my job, who would protect Beina? Sooner or later she would be laid off, since a criminal\u2019s wife was not supposed to have the same employment opportuni- 114 ties as others. Beina remained silent; I asked again, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d \u201cWait for him.\u201d I took a few spiced pumpkin seeds from a bowl, stood up, and went over to the window. Under the sill the radiator was hissing softly with a tiny steam leak. Outside, in the distance, \ufb01recrack- ers, one after another, scattered clusters of sparks in the indigo dusk. I turned around and said, \u201cHe is not worth waiting for. You must divorce him.\u201d \u201cNo, I will not,\u201d she moaned. \u201cWell, it is impossible for me to have a criminal as my son-in- law. I have been humiliated enough. If you want to wait for him, do not come to see me again.\u201d I put the pumpkin seeds back into the bowl, picked up my fur hat, and dragged myself out the door. 115",
    "TheDayTheCandersCame": "As soon as Fil woke up, he noticed a whiteness outside, quite unusual for the November mornings they had been having. That fall, Chicago was sandman\u2019s town, sleepy valley, drowsy gray, slumberous mistiness from sunup till noon when the clouds drifted away in cauliflower clusters and suddenly it was evening. The lights shone on the avenues like soiled lamps centuries old and the skyscrapers became monsters with a thousand sore eyes. Now there was a brightness in the air land Fil knew what it was and he shouted, \u201cSnow! It is snowing!\u201d Tony, who slept in the adjoining room, was awakened. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is snowing,\u201d Fil said, smiling to himself as if he had ordered this and was satisfied with the prompt delivery. \u201cOh, they will love this, they will love this.\u201d \u201cWho will love that?\u201d Tony asked, his voice raised in annoyance. \u201cThe dancers, of course,\u201d Fil answered. \u201cThey are arriving today. Maybe they have already arrived. They will walk in the snow and love it. Their first snow, I am sure.\u201d \u201cHow do you know it was not snowing in New York while they were there?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cSnow in New York in early November?\u201d Fil said. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d \u201cWho is crazy?\u201d Tony replied. \u201cEver since you heard of those dancers from the Philippines, you have been acting nuts. Loco. As if they are coming here just for you. Tony chuckled. Hearing him, Fil blushed, realizing that he had, indeed, been acting too eager, but Tony had said it. It felt that way\u2013as if the dancers were coming here only for him. Filemon Acayan, Filipino, was fifty, a YOU.S., citizen. He was a corporal in the YOU.S. Army, training at San Luis Obispo, on the day he was discharged honorably, in 1945. A few months later, he got his citizenship papers. Thousands of them, smart and small in their uniforms, stood at attention in drill formation, in the scalding sun, and pledged allegiance to the flat and the republic for which it stands. Soon after he got back to work. To a new citizen, work meant many places and many ways: factories and hotels, waiter and cook. A timeless drifting: once he tended a rose garden and took care of a hundred year old veteran of a border war. As a menial in a hospital in Cook Country, all day he handled filth and gore. He came home smelling of surgical soap and disinfectant. In the hospital, he took charge of row of bottles on a shelf, each bottle containing a stage of the human embryo in preservatives, from the lizard-like fetus of a few days, through the newly born infant, with its position unchanged, cold and cowering and afraid. He had nightmares through the years of himself inside a bottle. l That was long ago. Now he had a more pleasant job as special policemen in the post office. He was a few years younger than Tony-Antonio Bataller, a retired pullman porter but he looked older in inspite of the fact that Tony had been bedridden most of the time for the last two years, suffering from a kind of wasting disease that had frustrated doctors. All over Tony\u2019s body, a gradual peeling was taking place. l At first, he thought it was merely tiniaflava, a skin disease common among adolescent in the Philippines. It had started around the neck and had spread to his extremities. His face looked as if it was healing from sever burns. Nevertheless, it was a young face much younger than Fil\u2019s, which had never looked young. \u201cI am becoming a white man,\u201d Tony had said once, chuckling softly. It was the same chuckle Fil seemed to have heard now, only this time it sounded derisive, insulting. Fil said, \u201cI know who is nuts. It is the sick guy with the sick thoughts. You do not care for nothing but your pain, your imaginary pain.\u201d \u201cYou are the imagining fellow. I got the real thing,\u201d Tony shouted from the room. He believed he had something worse than the whiteness spreading on his skin. There was a pain in his insides, like dull scissors scraping his intestines. Angrily he added, \u201cWhat for I got retired?\u201d \u201cYou are old, man, old, that is what, and sick, yes, but not cancer,\u201d Fil said turning towards the snow-filled sky. He pressed his faced against the glass window. There is about an inch now on the ground, he thought, maybe more. Tony came out of his room looking as if he had not slept all night. \u201cI know what I got,\u201d he said, as if it were an honor and a privilege to die of cancer and Fill was trying to deprive him of it. \u201cNever a pain like this. One day, I am just going to die.\u201d \u201cNaturally. Who says you will not?\u201d Fil argued, thinking how wonderful it would be if he could join the company of dancers from the Philippines, show them around walk with them in the snow, watch their eyes as they stared about them, answer their questions, tell them everything they wanted to know about the changing seasons in this strange land. They would pick up fistfuls of snow, crunch it in their fingers or shove it into their mouths. He had done just that the first time, long, long ago, and it had reminded him of the grated ice the Chinese sold near the town plaza where he had played tatching with an older brother who later drowned in a squall. How his mother had grieved over that death, she who has not cried too much when his father died, a broken man. Now they were all gone, quick death after a storm, or lingeringly, in a season of drought, all, all of them he had loved. He continued, \u201cAll of us will die. One day. A medium bomb marked Chicago and this whole dump is tapus, finished. Who will escape then?\u201d \u201cMaybe your dancers will,\u201d Fil answered, now watching the snow himself. \u201cOf course, they will,\u201d Fil retorted, his voice sounding like a big assurance that all the dancers would be safe in his care. \u201cThe bombs will not be falling on this night. And when the dancers are back in the Philippines\u2026\u201d He paused, as if he was no longer sure of what he was going to say. \u201cBut maybe, even in the Philippines the bombs going to fall, no?\u201d he said, gazing sadly at the falling snow. \u201cWhat is that to you?\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou got no more folks over \u2018der right? I know it is nothing to me. I will be dead before that.\u201d \u201cLet us talk about something nice,\u201d Fil said, the sadness spreading on his face as he tried to smile. \u201cTell me, how will I talk, how am I going to introduce myself?\u201d He would go ahead with his plans, introduce himself to the dancers and volunteer to take them sight-seeing. His car was clean and ready for his guests. He had soaped the ashtrays, dusted off the floor boards and thrown away the old mats, replacing them with new plastic throw rugs. He had got himself soaking wet while spraying the car, humming, as he worked, faintly-remembered tunes from the old country. Fill shook his head as he waited for Tony to say something. \u201cGosh, I wish I had your looks, even with those white spots, then I could face everyone of them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this mug.\u201d \u201cThat is the important thing, you mug. It is your calling card. It says, Filipino. Countrymen,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou are not fooling me, friend,\u201d Fil said. \u201cThis mug says, Ugly Filipino. It says, old-timer, muchacho. It says Pinoy, bejo.\u201d For Fil, time was the villain. In the beginning, the words he often heard were: too young, too young; but all of a sudden, too young became too old, too late. What happened in between, a mist covering all things. You do not have to look at your face in a mirror to know that you are old, suddenly old, grown useless for a lot of things land too late for all the dreams you had wrapped up w ell against a day of need. \u201cIt also says sucker,\u201d Fil answered, \u201cbut who wants a palace when they can have the most delicious adobo here ands the best stuffed chicken\u2026 yum\u2026yum\u2026\u201d Tony was angry, \u201cYum, yum, you are nuts,\u201d he said, \u201cplain and simple loco. What for you want to spend? You have been living on loose change all your life and now on dancing kids who do not know you and will not even send you a card afterwards.\u201d \u201cNever mind the cards,\u201d Fil answered. \u201cWho wants cards? But do not you see, they will be happy; and then, you know what? I am going to keep their voices, their words and their singing and their laughter in my magic sound mirror.\u201d He had a portable tape recorder and a stack of recordings, patiently labeled, songs and speeches. The songs were in English, but most of the speeches were in the dialect, debates between him and Tony. It was evident Tony was the better speaker of the two in English, but in the dialect, Fil showed greater mastery. His style, however, was florid, sentimental, poetic. Without telling Tony, he had experimented on recording sounds, like the way a bed creaked, doors opening and closing, rain or sleet tapping on the window panes, footsteps through the corridor. He was beginning to think that they did. He was learning to identify each of the sounds with a particular mood or fact. Sometimes, like today, he wished that there was a way of keeping a record of silence because it was to him the richest sound, like snow falling. He wondered as he watched the snow blowing in the wind, what took care of that moment if memory did not. Like time, memory was often a villain, a betrayer. \u201cFall, snow, fall,\u201d he murmured and, turning to Tony, said, \u201cAs soon as they accept my invitation, I will call you up. No, you do not have to do anything, but I would want to be here to meet them.\u201d \u201cI am going out myself,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAnd I do not know what time I will be back.\u201dThen he added. \u201cYou are not working today. Are you on leave?\u201d \u201cFor two days. While the dancers are here.\u201d Fil said. \u201cIt still do not make sense to me,\u201d Tony said. \u201cBut good luck, any way.\u201d \u201cAre not you going to see them tonight? Our reserved seats are right out in front, you know.\u201d \u201cI know. But I am not sure I can come.\u201d \u201cWhat? You are not sure?\u201d Fil could not believe it. Tony was indifferent. Something must be wrong with him. He looked at him closely, saying nothing. \u201cI want to, but I am sick Fil. I tell you, I am not feeling so good. My doctor will know today. He will tell me.\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhat will he tell you?\u201d \u201cHow do I know?\u201d \u201cI mean, what is he trying to find out?\u201d \u201cIf it is cancer,\u201d Tony said. l Without saying another word, he went straight back to is room. Fil remembered those times, at night, when Tony kept him awake with his moaning. When he called out to him, asking, \u201cTony, what is the matter?\u201d his sighs ceased for a while, but afterwards, Tony screamed, deadening his cries with a pillow against his mouth. When Fill rushed to his side, Tony dove him about the previous night, he would reply, \u201cI was dying,\u201d but it sounded more like disgust overt a nameless annoyance. Fil has misgivings, too, about the whiteness spreading on Tony\u2019s skin. He had heard of leprosy. Every time he thought of that dreaded disease, he felt tears in his eyes. In all the years he had been in America, he had not has a friend until he meet Tony whom he liked immediately and, in a way, worshipped, for all the things the man had which Fil knew he himself lacked. They had shared a lot together. They made merry on Christmas, sometimes got drunk and became loud. Fil recited poems in the dialect and praised himself. Tony fell to giggling and cursed all the railroad companies of America. But last Christmas, they had not gotten drunk. They had not even talked to each other on Christmas day. Soon, it would be Christmas again. The snow was still falling. \u201cWell, I will be seeing you,\u201d Fil said, getting ready to leave. \u201cTry to be home on time. I shall invites the dancers for luncheon or dinner maybe, tomorrow. But tonight, let us go to the theater together, ha?\u201d \u201cI will try,\u201d Tony answered. He did not need boots. He loved to walk in the snow. The air outside felt good. Fil lifted his face to the sky and closed his eyes as the snow and a wet wind drench his face. He stood that way for some time, crying, more, more to himself, drunk with snow and coolness. His car was parked a block away. As he walked towards it, he plowed into the snow with one foot and studied the scar he made, a hideous shape among perfect footmarks. He felt strong as his lungs filled with the cold air, as if just now it did not matter too much that he was the way he looked and his English way the way it was. But perhaps, he could talk to the dancers in his dialect. Why not? A heavy frosting of snow covered his car and as he wiped it off with his bare hands, he felt light and young, like a child at play, and once again, he raised his face to the sky and licked the flakes, cold and tasteless on his tongue. When Fil arrived at the Hamilton, it seemed to him the Philippine dancers had taken over the hotel. They were all over the lobby on the mezzanine, talking in groups animatedly, their teeth sparkling as they laughed, their eyes disappearing in mere slits of light. Some of the girls wore their black hair long. For a moment, the sight seemed too much for him who had but all forgotten how beautiful Philippine girls were. He wanted to look away, but their loveliness held him. He must do something, close his eyes perhaps. As he did so, their laughter came to him like a breeze murmurous with sounds native to his land. Later, he tried to relax, to appear inconspicuous. True, they were all very young, but there were a few elderly men and women who must have been their chaperons or well-wishers like him. He would smile at everyone who happened to look his way. Most of them smiled back, or rather, seemed to smile, but it was quick, without recognition, and might not have been for him but for someone else near or behind him. His lips formed the words he was trying to phrase in his mind: Ilocano ka? Bicol? Ano na, paisano? Comusta? Or should he introduce himself\u2014How? For what he wanted to say, the words did not come too easily, they were unfamiliar, they stumbled and broke on his lips into a jumble of incoherence. Suddenly, he felt as if he was in the center of a group where he was not welcome. All the things he had been trying to hide now showed: the age in his face, his horny hands. He knew it the instant he wanted to shake hands with the first boy who had drawn close to him, smiling and friendly. Fil put his hands in his pocket. Now he wished Tony had been with him. Tony would know what to do. He would harm these young people with his smile and his learned words. Fil wanted to leave, but he seemed caught up in the tangle of moving bodies that merged and broke in a fluid strangle hold. Everybody was talking, mostly in English. Once in a while he heard exclamations in the dialect right out of the past, conjuring up playtime, long shadows of evening on the plaza, barrio fiestas, misa de gallo. Time was passing and he had yet to talk to someone. Suppose he stood on a chair and addressed them in the manner of his flamboyant speeches recorded in his magic sound mirror? \u201cBeloved countrymen, lovely children of the Pearl of the Orient Seas, listen to me. I am Fil Acayan. I have come to volunteer my services. I am yours to command. Your servant. Tell me where you wish to go, what you want to see in Chicago. I know every foot of the lakeshore drive, all the gardens and the parks, the museums, the huge department stores, the planetarium. Let me be your guide. That is what I am offering you, a free tour of Chicago, and finally, dinner at my apartment on West Sheridan Road\u2013pork adobo and chicken relleno, name your dish. How about it, paisanos?\u201d No. That would be a foolish thing to do. They would laugh at him. He felt a dryness in his throat. He was sweating. As he wiped his face with a handkerchief, he bumped against a slim, short girl who quite gracefully, stepped aside, and for a moment he thought he would swoon in the perfume that enveloped him. It was fragrance, essence of camia, of ilang-ilang, and dama de noche. Two boys with sleek, pomaded hair were sitting near an empty chair. He sat down and said in the dialect, \u201cMay I invite you to my apartment?\u201d The boys stood up, saying, \u201cExcuse us, please,\u201d and walked away. He mopped his brow, but instead of getting discouraged, he grew bolder as though he hand moved one step beyond shame. Approaching another group, he repeated his invitation, and a girl with a mole on her upper lip, said, \u201cThank you, but we have no time.\u201d As he turned towards another group, he felt their eyes on his back. Another boy drifted towards him, but as soon as he began to speak, the boy said, \u201cPardon, please,\u201d and moved away. They were always moving away. As if by common consent, they had decided to avoid him, ignore his presence. Perhaps it was not their fault. They must have been instructed to do so. Or was it his looks that kept them away? The though was a sharpness inside him. After a while, as he wandered about the mezzanine, among the dancers, but alone, he noticed that they had begun to leave. Some had crowded noisily into the two elevators. He followed the others going down the stairs. Through the glass doors, he saw them getting into a bus parked beside the subway entrance on Dearborn. The snow had stopped falling; it was melting fast in the sun and turning into slush. As he moved about aimlessly, he felt someone touch him on the sleeve. It was one of the dancers, a mere boy, tall and thin, who was saying, \u201cExcuse, please.\u201d Fil realized he was in the way between another boy with a camera and a group posing in front of the hotel. \u201cSorry,\u201d Fill said, jumping away awkwardly. The crowd burst out laughing. Then everything became a blur in his eyes, a moving picture out of focus, but gradually, the figure cleared, there was mud on the pavement on which the dancers stood posing, and the sun throw shadows at their feet. Let them have fun, he said to himself, they are young and away from home. I have no business up their schedule, forcing my company on them. He watched the dancers till the last of them was on the bus. The voices came to him, above the traffic sounds. They waved their hands and smiled towards him as the bus started. Fil raised his hand to wave back, but stopped quickly, aborting the gesture. He turned to look behind him at whomever the dancers were waving their hands to. There was no one there except his own reflection in the glass door, a double exposure of himself and a giant plant with its thorny branches around him like arms in a loving embrace. Even before he opened the door to their apartment, Fil knew that Tony had not yet arrived. There were no boots outside on the landing. Somehow he felt relieved, for until then he did not know how he was going to explain his failure. From the hotel, he had driven around, cruised by the lakeshore drive, hoping he could see the dancers somewhere, in a park perhaps, taking pictures of the mist over the lake and the last gold on the trees now wet with melted snow, or on some picnic grounds, near a bubbling fountain. Still taking pictures of themselves against a background of Chicago\u2019s gray and dirty skyscrapers. He slowed down every time he saw a crowd, but the dancers were nowhere along his way. Perhaps they had gone to the theater to rehearse. He turned back before reaching Evanston. He felt weak, not hungry. Just the same, he ate, warming up some left-over food. The rice was cold, but the soup was hot and tasty. While he ate, he listened for footfalls. Afterwards, he lay down on the sofa and a weariness came over him, but he tried hard not to sleep. As he stared at the ceiling, he felt like floating away, but he kept his eyes open, willing himself hard to remain awake. He wanted to explain everything to Tony when he arrived. But soon his eyes closed against a weary will too tired and weak to fight back sleep\u2013and then there were voices. Tony was in the room, eager to tell his own bit of news. \u201cI have discovered a new way of keeping afloat,\u201d he was saying. \u201cWho wants to keep afloat?\u201d Fil asked. \u201cJust in case. In a shipwreck, for example,\u201d Tony said. \u201cNever mind shipwrecks. I must tell you about the dancers,\u201d Fil said. \u201cBut this is important,\u201d Tony insisted. \u201cThis way, you can keep floating indefinitely.\u201d \u201cWhat for indefinitely?\u201d Fil asked. \u201cSay in a ship\u2026 I mean, in an emergency, you are stranded without help in the middle of the Pacific or the Atlantic, you must keep floating till help comes\u2026\u201d Tony explained. \u201cMore better,\u201d Fil said, \u201cfind a way to reach shore before the sharks smells you. You discover that.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d Tony said, without eagerness, as though certain that there was no such way, that, after all, his discovery was worthless. \u201cNow you listen to me,\u201d Fil said, sitting up abruptly. As he talked in the dialect, Tony listened with increasing apathy. \u201cThere they were,\u201d Fil began, his tone taking on the orator\u2019s pitch, \u201cWho could have been my children if I had not left home\u2013 or yours, Tony. They gazed around them with wonder, smiling at me, answering my questions, but grudgingly, edging away as if to be near me were wrong, a violation in their rule book. But it could be that every time I opened my mouth, I gave myself away. I talked in the dialect, Ilocano, Tagalog, Bicol, but no one listened. They avoided me. They had been briefed too well: Do not talk to strangers. Ignore their invitations. Be extra careful in the big cities like New York and Chicago, beware of the old-timers, the Pinoys. Most of them are bums. Keep away ;from them. Be on the safe side\u2013stick together, entertain only those who have been introduced to you properly. \u201cI am sure they had such instructions, safety measures, they must have called them. What then could I have done, scream out my good intentions, prove my harmlessness and my love for them by beating my breast? Oh, but I loved them. You see, I was like them once. I, too, was nimble with my feet, graceful with my hands; and I had the tongue of a poet. Ask the village girls and the envious boys from the city\u2013but first you have to find them. After these many years, it will not be easy. You will have to search every suffering pace in the village gloom for a hint of youth and beauty or go where the grave-yards are and the tombs under the lime trees. One such face\u2026oh, God, what am I saying\u2026 \u201cAll I wanted was to talk to them, guide them around Chicago, spend money on them so that they would have something special to remember about us here when they return to our country. They would tell their folks: We melt a kind, old man, who took us to his apartment. It was not much of a place. It was old-like him. When we sat on the sofa in the living room, the bottom sank heavily, the broken springs touching the floor. But what a cook that man was! And how kind! We never thought that rice and adobo could be that delicious. And the chicken relleno! When someone asked what the stuffing was\u2013we had never tasted anything like it, he smiled saying, \u2018From heaven\u2019s supermarket\u2019 touching his head and pressing his heart like a clown as if heaven were there. He had his tape recorder which he called a magic sound mirror, and he had all of us record our voices. Say anything in the dialect, sing, if you please, our kundiman, please, he said, his eyes pleading, too. Oh, we had fun listening to the playback. When you are gone, the old man said, I shall listen to your voices with my eyes closed and you will be here again and I will not ever be alone, no, not anymore, after this. We wanted to cry, but he looked very funny, so we laughed and he laughed with us. \u201cBut, Tony, they would not come. They thanked me, but they said they had no time. Others said nothing. They looked through me. I did not exist. Or worse, I was unclean. Basura. Garbage. They were ashamed me. How could I be Filipino?\u201d The memory, distinctly recalled, was a rock on his breast. He grasped for breath. \u201cNow, let me teach you how to keep afloat,\u201d Tony said, but is was not Tony\u2019s voice. Fil was alone and gasping for air. His eyes opened slowly till he began to breathe more easily. The sky outside was gray. He looked at his watch\u2013a quarter past five. The show would begin at eight. There was time. Perhaps Tony would be home soon. The apartment was warming up. The radiators sounded full of scampering rats. He had a recording of that in his sound mirror. Fil smiled. He had an idea. He would take the sound mirror to the theater, take his seat close to the stage, and make tape recordings of the singing and the dances. Now he was wide-awake and somehow pleased with himself. The more he thought of the idea, the better he felt. If Tony showed up now\u2026 He sat up, listening. The radiators were quiet. There were no footfalls, no sound of a key turning. Late that night, back from the theater, Fill knew at once that Tony was back. The boots were outside the door. He, too, must be tired, and should not be disturb. He was careful not to make any noise. As he turned on the floor lamp, he thought that perhaps Tony was awake and waiting for him. They would listen together to a playback of the dances and songs Tony had missed. Then he would tell Tony what happened that day, repeating part of the dream. From Tony\u2019s bedroom came the regular breathing of a man sound asleep. To be sure, he looked into the room and in the half-darkness, Tony\u2019s head showed darkly, deep in a pillow, on its side, his knees bent, almost touching the clasped hands under his chin, an oversized fetus in the last bottle. Fill shut the door between them and went over to the portable. Now. He turned it on to low. At first nothing but static and odd sounds came through, but soon after there was the patter of feet to the rhythm of a familiar melody. All the beautiful boys and girls were in the room now, dancing and singing. A boy and a girl sat on the floor holding two bamboo poles by their ends flat on floor, clapping them together, then apart, and pounding them on the boards, while dancers swayed and balanced their lithe forms, dipping their bare brown legs in and out of the clapping bamboos, the pace gradually increasing into a fury of wood on wood in a counterpoint of panic among the dancers and in a harmonious flurry of toes and ankles escaping certain pain\u2013crushed bones, and bruised flesh, and humiliation. Other dances followed, accompanied by songs and live with the sounds of life and death in the old country; I go rot natives in G-strings walking down a mountainside; peasants climbing up a hill on a rainy day; neighbors moving a house, their sturdy legs showing under a moving roof; a distant gong sounding off a summons either to a feast for a wake. And finally, prolonged ovation, thunderous, wave upon wave\u2026 \u201cTurn that thing off!\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was sharp above the echoes of the gongs and the applause settling into silence. Fil switched off the dial and in the sudden stillness, the voices turned into faces, familiar and near, like gesture and touch that stayed on even as the memory withdrew, bowing out, as it were, in a graceful exit, saying, thank you, thank you, before a ghostly audience that clapped hands in silence and stomped their feet in a such emptiness. He wanted to join the finale, such as it was, pretend that the curtain call included him, and attempt a shamefaced imitation of a graceful adieu, but he was stiff and old, incapable of grace; but he said, thank you, thank you, his voice sincere and contrite, grateful for the other voices and the sound of singing and the memory. \u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d the man in the other room cried, followed by a moan of such anguish that Fil fell on his knees, covering the sound mirror with his hands to muffle the sounds that had started again, it seemed to him, even after he had turned it off. Then he remembered. \u201cTony, what did the doctor say? What did he say?\u201d he shouted and listened, holding his breath, no longer able to tell at the moment who had truly waited all day for the final sentence. There was no answer. Meanwhile, under his hands, there was Tony saying? That was his voice, no? Fil wanted to hear, he must know. He switched dials on and off, again and again, pressing buttons. Suddenly, he did not know what to do. The spool were live, they kept turning. His arms went around the machine, his chest pressing down on the spools. In the quick silence, Tony\u2019s voice came clear. \u201cSo they did not come after all?\u201d \u201cTony, what did the doctor say?\u201d Fil asked, straining hard to hear. \u201cI knew they would not come. But that is okay. The apartment is old anyhow. And it smells of death.\u201d \u201cHow you talk. In this country, there is a cure for everything.\u201d \u201cI guess we cannot complain. We had it good here all the time. Most of the time, anyway.\u201d \u201cI wish, though, they had come. I could\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, they could have. They did not have to see me, but I could have seen them. I have seen their pictures, but what do they really look like?\u201d \u201cTony, they are beautiful, all of them, but especially the girls. Their complexion, their grace, their eyes, they were what we call talking eyes, they say, things to you. And the scent of them!\u201d There was a sigh from the room soft, hardly like a sigh. A louder, grating sound, almost under his hands that had relaxed their hold, called his attention. The sound mirror had kept going, the tape was fast unraveling. \u201cOh, no! he screamed, noticing that somehow, he had pushed the eraser. Frantically, he tried to rewind and play back the sounds and the music, but there was nothing now but the full creaking of the tape on the spool and meaningless sounds that somehow had not been erased, the thud of dancing feet, a quick clapping of hands, alien voices and words: in this country\u2026 everything\u2026 all of them\u2026 talking eyes\u2026 and the scent\u2026 a fading away into nothingness, till about the end when there was a screaming, senseless kind of finale detached from the body of a song in the background, drums and sticks and the tolling of a bell. \u201cTony! Tony!\u201d Fil cried, looking towards the sick man\u2019s room, \u201cI have lost them all.\u201d Biting his lips, Fil turned towards the window, startled by the first light of the dawn. He had not realized till then the long night was over.",
    "TheWhiteUmbrella": "When I was twelve, my mother went to work without telling me or my little sister. \u201cNot that we need the second income.\u201d The lilt of her accent drifted from the kitchen up to the top of the stairs, where Mona and I were listening. \u201cNo,\u201d said my father, in a barely audible voice. \u201cNot like the Lee family.\u201d The Lees were the only other Chinese family in town. I remembered how sorry my parents had felt for Mrs. Lee when she started waitressing downtown the year before; and so when my mother began coming home late, I did not say anything and tried to keep Mona from saying anything either. \u201cBut why should not I?\u201d she argued. \u201cLots of people\u2019s mothers work.\u201d \u201cThose are American people,\u201d I said. \u201cSo what do you think we are? I can do the pledge of allegiance with my eyes closed.\u201d Nevertheless, she tried to be discreet; and if my mother was not home by 5:30, we would start cooking by ourselves, to make sure dinner would be on time. Mona would wash the vegetables and put on the rice; I would chop. For weeks we wondered what kind of work she was doing. I imagined that she was selling perfume, testing dessert recipes for the local newspaper. Or maybe she was working for the florist. Now that she had learned to drive, she might be delivering boxes of roses to people. \u201cI do not think so,\u201d said Mona as we walked to our piano lesson after school. \u201cShe would have hit something by now.\u201d A gust of wind littered the street with leaves. \u201cMaybe we better hurry up,\u201d she went on, looking at the sky. \u201cIt is going to pour.\u201d \u201cBut we are too early.\u201d Her lesson did not begin until 4:00, mine until 4:30, so we usually tried to walk as slowly as we could. \u201cAnd anyway, those are not the kind of clouds that rain. Those are cumulus clouds.\u201d We arrived out of breath and wet. \u201cOh you poor, poor dears,\u201d said old Miss Crosman. \u201cWhy do not you call me the next time it is like this out? If your mother will not drive you, I can come pick you up.\u201d \u201cNo, that is okay,\u201d I answered. Mona wrung her hair out on Miss Crossman\u2019s rug. \u201cWe just could not get the roof our car to close, is all. We took it to the beach last summer and got sand in the mechanism.\u201d I pronounced this last word carefully, as if the credibility of my lie depended on its middle syllable. \u201cIt is never been the same.\u201d I thought for a second. \u201cIt is a convertible.\u201d \u201cWell the make yourselves at home.\u201d She exchanged looks with Eugenie Roberts, whose lesson we were interrupting. Eugenie smiled good-naturedly. \u201cThe towels are in the closet across from the bathroom.\u201d Huddling at the end of Miss Crosman\u2019s nine-foot leather couch, Mona and I watched Eugenie play. She was a grade ahead of me and, according to school rumor, had a boyfriend in high school. I believed it\u2026 She had auburn hair, blue eyes, and, I noted with a particular pang, a pure white folding umbrella. \u201cI cannot see,\u201d whispered Mona. \u201cSo clean your glasses.\u201d \u201cMy glasses are clean. You are in the way.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cThey look dirty to me.\u201d \u201cThat is because your glasses are dirty.\u201d Eugenie came bouncing to the end of her piece. \u201cOh! Just stupendous!\u201d Miss Crosman hugged her, then looked up as Eugenie\u2019s mother walked in. \u201cStupendous!\u201d she said again. \u201cOh! Mrs. Roberts! Your daughter has a gift, a real gift. It is an honor to teach her.\u201d Mrs. Roberts, radiant with pride, swept her daughter out of the room as if she were royalty, born to the piano bench. Watching the way Eugenie carried herself, I sat up and concentrated so hard on sucking in my stomach that I did not realize until the Robertses were gone that Eugenie had left her umbrella. As Mona began to play, I jumped up and ran to the window, meaning to call to them \u2013 only to see their brake lights flash then fade at the stop sign at the corner. As if to allow them passage, the rain had let up; a quivering sun lit their way. The umbrella glowed like a scepter on the blue carpet while Mona, slumping over the keyboard, managed to eke out a fair rendition of a cat fight. At the end of the piece, Miss Crosman asked her to stand up. \u201cStay right there,\u201d she said, then came back a minute later with a towel to cover the bench. \u201cYou must be cold,\u201d she continued. \u201cShall I call your mother and have her bring over some dry clothes?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d answered Mona. \u201cShe will not come because she\u2026\u201d \u201cShe is too busy,\u201d I broke in from the back of the room. \u201cI see.\u201d Miss Crosman sighed and shook her head a little. \u201cYour glasses are filthy, honey,\u201d she said to Mona. \u201cShall I clean them for you?\u201d Sisterly embarrassment seized me. Why had not Mona wiped her lenses when I told her to? As she resumed abuse of the piano, I stared at the umbrella. I wanted to open it, twirl it around by its slender silver handle; I wanted to dangle it from my wrist on the way to school the way the other girls did. I wondered what Miss Crosman would say if I offered to bring it to Eugenie at school tomorrow. She would be impressed with my consideration for others; Eugenie would be pleased to have it back; and I would have possession of the umbrella for an entire night. I looked at it again, toying with the idea of asking for one for Christmas. I knew, however, how my mother would react. \u201cThings,\u201d she would say. \u201cWhat is the matter with a raincoat? All you want is things, just like an American.\u201d Sitting down for my lesson, I was careful to keep the towel under me and sit up straight. \u201cI will bet you cannot see a thing wither,\u201d said Miss Crosman, reaching for my glasses. \u201cAnd you can relax, you poor dear\u2026This is not a boot camp.\u201d When Miss Crosman finally allowed me to start playing, I played extra well, as well as I possibly could. See, I told her with my fingers. You do not have to feel sorry for me. \u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d said Miss Crosman. \u201cOh! Just wonderful.\u201d An entire constellation rose in my heart. \u201cAnd guess what,\u201d I announced proudly. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d Then I played a second piece for her, a much more difficult one that she had not assigned. \u201cOh! That was stupendous,\u201d she said without hugging me. \u201cStupendous! You are a genius, young lady. If your mother had started you younger, you would be playing like Eugenie Roberts by now!\u201d I looked at the keyboard, wishing that I had still a third, even more difficult piece to play for her. I wanted to tell her that I was the school spelling bee champion, that I was not ticklish, that I could do karate. \u201cMy mother is a concert pianist,\u201d I said. She looked at me for a long moment, then finally, without saying anything, hugged me. I did not say anything about bringing the umbrella to Eugenie at school. The steps were dry when Mona and I sat down to wait for my mother. \u201cDo you want to wait inside?\u201d Miss Crosman looked anxiously at the sky. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cOur mother will be here any minute.\u201d \u201cIn a while,\u201d said Mona. \u201cAny minute,\u201d I said again, even though my mother had been at least twenty minutes late every week since she started working. According to the church clock across the street we had been waiting twenty-five minutes when Miss Crosman came out again. \u201cShall I give you ladies a ride home?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cOur mother is coming any minute. \u201cShall I at least give her a call and remind her you are here? Maybe she forgot about you.\u201d \u201cI do not think she forgot,\u201d said Mona. \u201cShall I give her a call anyway? Just to be safe?\u201d \u201cI bet she already left,\u201d I said. \u201cHow could she forget about us?\u201d Miss Crosman went in to call. \u201cThere is no answer,\u201d she said, coming back out. \u201cSee, she is on her way,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you sure you would not like to come in?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Mona. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. I pointed at my sister. \u201cShe meant yes too. She meant no, she would not like to go in.\u201d Miss Crosman looked at her watch. \u201cIt is 5:30 now, ladies. My pot roast will be coming out in fifteen minutes. Maybe you would like to come in and have some then?\u201d \u201cMy mother\u2019s almost here,\u201d I said. \u201cShe is on her way.\u201d We watched and watched the street. I tried to imagine what my mother was doing; I tried to imagine her writing messages in the sky, even though I knew she was afraid of planes. I watched as the branches of Miss Crosman\u2019s big willow tree started to sway; they had all been trimmed to exactly the same height off the ground, so they looked beautiful, like hair in the wind. It started to rain. \u201cMiss Crosman is coming out again,\u201d said Mona. \u201cDo not let her talk you into going inside,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause that would mean Mom really is not coming any minute.\u201d \u201cBut she is not,\u201d said Mona. \u201cShe is working.\u201d \u201cShhh! Miss Crosman\u2019s going to hear you.\u201d \u201cShe is working! She is working! She is working!\u201d I put my hand over her mouth, but she licked it, and so I was wiping my hand on my wet dress when the front door opened. \u201cWe are getting even wetter,\u201d said Mona right away. \u201cWetter and wetter.\u201d \u201cShall we all go in?\u201d Miss Crosman pulled Mona to her feet. \u201cBefore you young ladies catch pneumonia? You have been out here an hour already.\u201d \u201cWe are freezing.\u201d Mona looked up at Miss Crosman. \u201cDo you have any hot chocolate? We are going to catch pneumonia.\u201d \u201cI am not going in,\u201d I said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s coming any minute.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d said Mona. \u201cUse your noggin.\u201d \u201cAny minute.\u201d \u201cCome on, Mona,\u201d Miss Crosman opened the door. \u201cShall we get you inside first? \u201cSee you in the hospital,\u201d said Mona as she went in. \u201cSee you in the hospital with pneumonia.\u201d I stared out into the empty street. The rain was prickling me all over; I was cold; I wanted to go inside. I wanted to be able to let myself go inside. If Miss Crosman came out again, I decided, I would go in. She came out with a blanket and the white umbrella. I could not believe that I was actually holding the umbrella, opening it. It sprang up by itself as if it were alive, as if that were what it wanted to do \u2013 as if it belonged in my hands, above my head. I stared up at the network of silver spokes, then spun the umbrella around and around and around. It was so clean and white that it seemed to glow, to illuminate everything around it. \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d I said. Miss Crosman sat down next to me, on one end of the blanket. I moved the umbrella over so that it covered that too. I could feel the rain on my left shoulder and shivered. She put her arm around me. \u201cYou poor, poor dear.\u201d I knew that I was in store for another bolt of sympathy, and braced myself by staring up into the umbrella. \u201cYou know, I very much wanted to have children when I was younger,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou did?\u201d She stared at me a minute. Her face looked dry and crusty, like day-old frosting. \u201cI did. But then I never got married.\u201d I twirled the umbrella around again. \u201cThis is the most beautiful umbrella I have ever seen,\u201d I said. \u201cEver, in my whole life.\u201d \u201cDo you have an umbrella?\u201d \u201cNo. But my mother\u2019s going to get me one just like this for Christmas.\u201d \u201cIs she? I tell you what. You do not have to wait until Christmas. You can have this one.\u201d \u201cBut this one belongs to Eugenie Roberts,\u201d I protested. \u201cI have to give it back to her tomorrow in school.\u201d \u201cWho told you it belongs to Eugenie? It is not Eugenie\u2019s. It is mine. And now I am giving it to you, so it is yours.\u201d \u201cIt is mine?\u201d I did not know what to say. \u201cMine?\u201d Suddenly I was jumping up and down in the rain. \u201cIt is beautiful! Oh! It is beautiful!\u201d I laughed. Miss Crosman laughed too, even though she was getting all wet. \u201cThank you, Miss Crosman. Thank you very much. Thanks a zillion. It is beautiful. It is stupendous!\u201d \u201cYou are quite welcome,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said again, but that did not seem like enough. Suddenly I knew just what she wanted to hear. \u201cI wish you were my mother.\u201d Right away I felt bad. \u201cYou should not say that,\u201d she said, but her face was opening into a huge smile as the lights of my mother\u2019s car cautiously turned the corner. I quickly collapsed the umbrella and put it up my skirt, holding onto it from the outside, through the material. \u201cMona!\u201d I shouted into the house. \u201cMona! Hurry up! Mom\u2019s here! I told you she was coming!\u201d Then I ran away from Miss Crosman, down to the curb. Mona came tearing up to my side as my mother neared the house. We both backed up a few feet so that in case she went onto the curb, she would not run us over. \u201cBut why did not you go inside with Mona?\u201d my mother asked on the way home. She had taken off her own coat to put over me and had the heat on high. \u201cShe was not using her noggin,\u201d said Mona, next to me in the back seat. \u201cI should call next time,\u201d said my mother. \u201cI just do not like to say where I am.\u201d That was when she finally told us that she was working as a checkout clerk in the A&P. She was supposed to be on the day shift, but the other employees were unreliable, and her boss had promised her a promotion if she would stay until the evening shift filled in. For a moment no one said anything. Even Mona seemed to find the revelation disappointing. \u201cA promotion already!\u201d she said, finally. I listened to the windshield wipers. \u201cYou are so quiet.\u201d My mother looked at me in the rear view mirror. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d \u201cI wish you would quit,\u201d I said after a moment. She sighed. \u201cThe Chinese have a saying: one beam cannot hold the roof up.\u201d \u201cBut Eugenie Roberts\u2019s father supports their family.\u201d She sighed once more. \u201cEugenie Roberts\u2019s father is Eugenie Roberts\u2019s father,\u201d she said. As we entered the downtown area, Mona started leaning hard against me every time the car turned right, trying to push me over. Remembering what I had said to Miss Crosman, I tried to maneuver the umbrella under my leg so she would not feel it. \u201cWhat is under your skirt?\u201d Mona wanted to know as we came to a traffic light. My mother, watching us in the rear view mirror again, rolled slowly to a stop. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere is something under her skirt,\u201d said Mona, pulling at me. \u201cUnder her skirt.\u201d Meanwhile, a man crossing the street started to yell at us. \u201cWho do you think you are, lady?\u201d he said. \u201cYou are blocking the whole crosswalk.\u201d We all froze. Other people walking by stopped to watch. \u201cDid not you hear me?\u201d he went on, starting to thump on the hood with his fist. \u201cDo not you speak English?\u201d My mother began to back up, but the car behind us honked. Luckily, the light turned green right after that. She sighed in relief. \u201cWhat were you saying, Mona?\u201d she asked. We would not have hit the car behind us that hard if he had not been moving too but as it was, our car bucked violently, throwing us all first back and then forward. \u201cUh oh,\u201d said Mona when we stopped. \u201cAnother accident.\u201d I was relieved to have attention diverted from the umbrella. Then I noticed my mother\u2019s head, tilted back onto the seat. Her eyes were closed. \u201cMom!\u201d I screamed. \u201cMom! Wake up!\u201d She opened her eyes. \u201cPlease do not yell,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough people are going to yell already.\u201d \u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d I said, starting to cry. \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d She turned around, looking at me intently, then put her hand to my forehead. \u201cSick,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cSome kind of sick is giving you crazy ideas.\u201d As the man from the car behind us started tapping on the window, I moved the umbrella away from my leg. Then Mona and my mother were getting out of the car. I got out after them; and while everyone else was inspecting the damage we would done, I threw the umbrella down a sewer.",
    "DonutMan": "When he woke me, it was still dark. I would been curled into the passenger seat of the van while he stripped and waxed the tile of a Jiffy Lube. \u201cBeak,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us get after it.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d was money. I knew because, for the past few months, we spent our unsupervised visitations working one of his businesses. My father never had a steady paycheck. His odd jobs rewarded only hustle. I was nine - when I stayed with him, he would sleep through the afternoon while I read for school or played Gameboy, then rush me through dinner to make it to a flooring job. We showed up late after the businesses had closed. I would help him unload the van, sometimes sweep or mop, but I was too young for the thin hours of the night. When I got tired, I lay down in front seat, the whir of cars lulling me to sleep as they passed. There were days I would wake up while we were on the go, unaware of the movement, but on nights when the job ran long, nights like this one, we went straight to the donut factory. This was before Krispy Kreme had their own stores, before they had a station in every Giant and Safeway up the coast and still garnered interest in their rarity. Guys like my father - hands raw from disinfectant, the soles of his New Balance slick with wax - showed up with the sun to stuff their vehicles with the green and white boxes, hoping to resell them and pocket the markup. It was the Saturday before Thanksgiving, and holidays made for easy sales, but even so, I knew we would have trouble unloading the amount he insisted on buying. His Aerostar van was a windowless smoky black with the chrome stripped off. While he loaded boxes in the back of it from floor mat to bare ceiling, careful to keep everything separate from the mop buckets, the floor buffer, I watched the workers make donuts in the back of the factory through the viewing window. The circles of dough drift along in a river of oil, starting soft white, dropped straight from the dispenser and ending on the drying rack, golden-brown, the sugar coming up in fumes. \u201cBeak, get your face off the glass,\u201d he said. My father called me \u201cBeak\u201d because, while we were both Chinese, I had not yet grown into my mom\u2019s British nose. We had not spent more than a weekend together since the divorce four years prior. He took his billfold from his pocket, peeled off a couple ones and handed it the floor manager who knocked on the glass and held up two fingers. On the other side of the window, the bakers wore plastic aprons and latex gloves, hairnets and safety goggles. They took two donuts straight off the conveyer belt, slid them in a wax paper sleeve and brought them out to us. The heat of the pastry in my hands created a hunger I had not known, and I swallowed the donut in three bites. It was barely solid, so sweet it made my teeth ache, and I wanted another immediately. \u201cWhen was the last time your mom fed you something this good for breakfast?\u201d I was too busy licking the glaze off the back of my teeth to think about my usual breakfast - the off - brand cheerios dense as cardboard wet with rice milk, both donated from the church my mother dragged me to. Depending how far we were from her last paycheck, the meals became less complex. At first, pasta, homemade sauce, saut\u00e9ed vegetables, salted chicken, and a week later, plain rice, canned tuna, soy sauce for flavor. Those meals, she would stir her food between bites, as if it were hiding beneath it something worth savoring. I often tried to choose relative hunger instead of clearing my plate. We would push it back and forth between us on the table until she would slam a fist down, saying, \u201cEat, dammit. I do not work this hard for you to spit in my face.\u201d There was something raw in her tone. When the dishes stopped rattling, her voice cooled. \u201cI am sorry, baby. Please.\u201d Our route took us from the factory back toward his basement studio. We used to hit the strips of business parks and car lots congesting the main roads reaching out from 495 and the District. Rockville, Gaithersburg, College Park, Laurel - any hospitality service that needed giveaways or a staff that might want breakfast. The spots my father sold to often, the receptionists would declare \u2018Donut Man!\u201d as we came through the door, boxes stacked on my forearms. When we were entered somewhere new, he said it himself. At a car dealership, he leaned against the counter, speaking to a woman on the other side. The Tag Heuer watch hanging from his wrist was older than me. One time my mother joked that it would been in and out of pawnshops as often as my father had been in and out of jail. The mention of prison took the humor from her face. \u201cMind your manners, Jason,\u201d he said. \u201cTell Miss Cindy hello.\u201d As a kid, I would been mild in temperament - bad at making eye contact, prone to long passages of silence - but we were a father/son sales team, and part of that act required me to smile when addressed. I am not sure when my big - gummed grin became genuine, warmed by the attention. I said hi as my father opened the box on the top of the stack. Miss Cindy looked at the variety dozen, then me, saying, \u201cWell, I do not know which is sweeter.\u201d We set the donuts on the counter, folded bills, returned to the van to restock. My father only really taught me two things in life. The first was how to take money off people who had it to spend. We were on the beltway, and he decided we could sell more if we split up. Awake all night cleaning floors, he was beginning to fade as the day wore on. He would not admit it, but his eyes were ringed red, and we would barely made a dent in the product. I was worried that no one would want to buy from just me - no jewelry, no swagger or familiarity - but he assured me, saying, \u201cAll you got to do is treat them like you love them. Bat your eyes a little. If they do not want to buy, hey, no sweat, see you next time. Thanks anyway. You cannot make anyone do anything.\u201d The next stop in Tacoma Park, he gave me enough cash to make change, then put me out on my own. We priced a dozen glazed at ten, the assorted boxes of jelly and chocolate and Bavarian creams for thirteen, one of each for twenty. I kept repeating this pitch in my head as I went into the stores. My first few attempts - a laundry mat, a Radioshack, the Post Office - were met with polite rejections. I was too courteous, entering silently and waiting in line. The mail clerk behind the glass barricade looked at the boxes, then over my head and toward the door before saying no with a smile. I crossed the street, my arms shaking a bit under the weight of the boxes. There was a bank on the corner, and as I approached the wide, double doors, a woman held one open for me, saying, \u201cAre not you precious.\u201d Part of me worried I was moving too slowly, that I would have kept my father waiting and his impatience would turn to anger or disappointment. Part of me worried I would come back without making a sale. I walked past the velvet ropes and the stanchions that formed a queue to the tellers toward a man sitting at the desk in the middle of the lobby. I said \u201cKrispy Kreme!\u201d when I was within ear shot. He said, \u201cWell what have you got here?\u201d and I gave him the pitch, the pricing. The bank manager was older, his hair thin at the temples, silver roses patterned across his tie. He told me they had a meeting coming up in an hour, and would not it be nice to provide some refreshments for the brokers and reps that morning? He bought everything I was carrying, and I skipped back to the van waving the cash like a trophy. My father had just closed the sliding door. When he saw me, he snatched the money from my hand, a bit of spit coming off his lip as he asked me if I was stupid. He said, \u201cYou know the best way to lose something, Beak? Let someone know you have it to lose.\u201d In the passenger seat, I shrunk into the cushion, resting my head against the doorframe. He closed the door and sat, joining the money I would earned with the roll in his pocket. Before we left the parking lot, he took his bifocals off and polished the dust from the lenses. He said, \u201cYou need to know how to be careful.\u201d Always count the money by the door. The trick is to keep small bills on the outside and stow it in your front pocket where it is hard to get to. The skin on his knuckles looked like worn leather sliding into his jeans, his old graduation ring studding his pinky. To this day, I have never misplaced a bill. Each stop, we split up. Halfway around the beltway, I came back from my rounds to find him napping. With the holiday around the corner and a bit of encouragement, people were looking for excuses to indulge. The ease of the sales only fueled this new confidence. Each time I came back to the van, empty-handed, I was fired up. Eventually, my mom would lock him up again for falling too far behind on the child support, but just then, I rode shotgun, a stomach made for sugar and a newfound love of counting cash. Stop after stop, while he napped, I hefted the donuts into my arms, brought the boxes into doctor\u2019s offices and furniture stores, real estate headquarters and used car lots, pulling back the glass and saying, \u201cKrispy Kreme!\u201d I woke him when we needed to move, and halfway around the beltway, I sold the last dozen glazed to a dentist off Route 1. The wad in my pocket was so thick my pants fit tighter. I knuckled him in the bicep, and he rubbed his eyes, pushed his bifocals up the bridge of his nose. He said, \u201cWhere to?\u201d \u201cHome.\u201d \u201cWe have got work to do, Beak,\u201d he said. The cough in his waking throat sounded thick with mucous. \u201cWhere to?\u201d \u201cHome,\u201d I said. \u201cThey are all gone.\u201d Maybe it was exhaustion, but the wrinkled brow, the pinched confusion of his expression made me feel like I was lying to him. He turned in the seat to the belly of the van, empty now except for the cleaning supplies, the comforter that covered them. When he smiled, I could see the gold crowns glowing like embers in the back of his mouth. He dropped the van into gear and put us on the road. On good days, we would get wings and rib - tips from a Chinese carry-out around the corner from his basement studio. We would each eat half of one dish then trade. Side by side, in the front of the van, we ate until our forks scraped the bottom of the styrofoam trays, until we unbuttoned our jeans to get comfortable. \u201cYour mother and I used to live above a spot like this in Wheaton. The kitchen was below our bedroom. Just the smell of chicken would turn her stomach, but you know, I was always craving it,\u201d he said. \u201cI bet she still does not let you eat it.\u201d \u201cShe says eating out is a waste of money.\u201d Cartilage from the pork cracked between his teeth, and he grunted the bone into a napkin. My arms, my feet, ached from the hustle. In the driveway, we instinctively opened the sliding door on the van to carry in what we could not get rid of - the donuts we would eat for dinner. But I would sold us out. In my pocket was the proof. I showed it too him - the roll of bills suspended between us bulging out my fist, and I felt alive. \u201cHey, Donut man,\u201d he said standing over me, inspecting the features of my face. I could see my reflection in his glasses, distorted by the curve of the lens. We were so much the same except for those small and important differences that are lost when the eye is not focused - how I do not fully recognize myself now when it is four in the morning and I am washing my face in the sink after a shift, the tips in my jeans still damp from the beer-slick bar; how, tired and worn thinner by liquor, I look out the window and cannot tell if the sun is coming soon or just gone. With his finger, he tapped me on the nose, saying, \u201cHand it over.\u201d",
    "TheBridalSet": "I had forgotten that it was a city of plans. People made them, penciled them into calendars, popped their collars and showed up with honesty on their faces. In those days, I had none. What I had were some button-downs in a carry-on, a scraped and stinging elbow from an escalator incident at the airport, an empty booze cabinet with a single can of tonic water waiting for me at my hotel. It was Bombay in May. Glasses went milky when doors opened, when doors closed. I waited for Manish by the door of The Polo Bar, where a line for entry was beginning to form despite the early hour. As I waited, the rain beat the awning over my head in sheets, sounded like an animal being lashed. I was visiting India because I could tell from my wife\u2019s face when she walked into a room that she had hoped I was not there. You can only see a woman\u2019s face turn so swiftly, with such surety that the smile ought to disappear, so many times before you believe it might be time to change something about yourself, or in my case, to take a flight. So I was glad to be there, my collar encircled with damp, the air heavy with its familiar salt and whiff of petrol, my presence unremarked by the passing bodies who hurried towards and past me, into the bar. One of these bodies, burly and short in a black T-shirt that strained to make the distance across his chest and biceps, approached me the way you approach air conditioning: skin warm, arms splayed, smile rippling. In the days before we became husbands and fathers, before our real lives happened, Manish was a stud, a stallion, a St. Mary\u2019s head boy, and eventually, a Rolex-wearing paper magnate. He was one of those mythological figures who received proposals through the ringing telephone, families from Lucknow and Hyderabad who saw him shimmering at so-and-so is wedding, families hoping they needed to arrange just one coffee between him and their newly graduated daughter to gain a son-in-law. The rest of us had to do it the hard way. You would show up freshly shaved to whatever second cousin\u2019s friend\u2019s house, sit in a corner with the girl\u2019s father and brothers, hoping the girl in question spared you a single glance. Just one! And if she did, then the afternoon was spent in a spell of drowsy relief. Relief that Manish would never need to know, for when he was twenty-four, he had fallen in love with a London-born Delhi girl on a work trip, brought her home to Bombay, and watched pridefully as she went off on Marxist sermons in the corners of parties. But to their story too, there was a crisp turning of the lock that marked the end. After three decades, their marriage was over. Manish was on his own now, looking for work. The rumors of his rough patch, as we would come to call these phases of our lives, were floated to me through a chain of our oldest friends. The year before, returning home to India from a trip abroad, Manish had walked into his living room full of company executives\u2014his uncles and brothers, his father, his petite wife at the head. He was advised to accept his share of assets and bow out of the business. They deemed him unfit to stand at the helm based on his penchant for luxury items. They pointed at his shoes, his watch, his gold-plated cufflinks, which he had recently gotten engraved with his initials, M. M. Ticking beneath this meeting and its excuses for Manish\u2019s expulsion was a nastier, truer thread of news circulated on group chats that did not include him. They claimed that his wife, the Marxist, had fallen in love with Manish\u2019s father. Together they had plotted to remove Manish from their lives. About this, people speculated, changed their stories, agreed and disagreed, but the verdict of the whole saga floated above their chatter like a big gray cloud that no one wanted to see. The fact was that parents and children alike could do unspeakable things. We walked through The Polo Bar slowly, like two men in trouble. It was a time in my life when I believed that everyone was suspicious of me. I felt they could see through to my brain, that endless list of knots I needed to untie in this lifetime. The bastards I needed to forgive and the bigger bastards I needed to forgive me. My unending roster of debts uncollected and owed. Would they ever stop accruing? I thought then that life was just that: a trip to the bank. You racked up credit, accidentally used it all, and found yourself sitting across from a teller in Malabar Hill, sliding a wad of rupee bills under the table, asking for access to your dead mother\u2019s bank locker in order to liquidate her old wedding jewelry. As we walked to our table, I searched Manish\u2019s profile for a glint of these stories, for a clue of our shared aloneness, but he had his teeth whitened recently and that was all I could see. Two rows of piano keys bright as mercury. I had been to The Polo Bar as a kid, snuck a sip of my father\u2019s Macallan on the rocks and was smacked across the face for doing so. Back then the bar was a daytime visit, a post-newspaper and tea meeting point for the families of Malabar Hill who had been invited to join the club as members. You were either invited, referred, or given membership in the will of an aloof and long-dead parent or grandparent. It was a big deal back then to receive one of those handwritten invitations to interview at the Hill Club. If you made it through, it meant you were a well-talked-about family, a family with one Mama and one Papa, with no divorces or suicides rotting leaves on the family tree. What you got for your good reputation and sturdy financial sense was access to a tennis court, The Polo Bar, and a pale blue lap pool that no one used, because most apartment buildings on the hill had pools anyway. A group of people who seemed to know Manish floated over to say hello as we took our seats. I did not recognize any of them and did not feel the need to make new friends. I was slightly disturbed by how drastically the bar had changed. I looked up from the anonymous, powdered faces of Manish\u2019s friends and saw what used to be. She Will-white walls, rattan furniture, bamboo ceiling fans that rotated slowly and uselessly overhead. A number of indoor plants, bright and unfurling, host to small swarms of insects that hovered permanently above their colors. No televisions, only an omnipresent radio that announced the highlights of whatever cricket match was happening that week. Sunlight would splash on the tables like paint, the day\u2019s dust dipping and swirling around us. My little sister, her hair strung up in two asymmetrical ponytails, beaming demonically at me for anticipation of some prank she would pulled that I was not aware of just yet. Salt inside my glass of Coke, etcetera. Now the bar was polished and dark, a halfway imitation of an American dive. It was remodeled in the early 2000s with marbled wood and central air conditioning, a verbal history provided by the mustached manager, who trotted over at some point with a big slap on Manish\u2019s shoulder. The air was dry and cool and our waiter brought over large jugs of iced water.It was a farewell to the delicious dampness that made places like this buzz, though I thought I felt a raindrop land on my skull. When I looked up, I saw that the fans had remained. They were frozen above us, those gorgeous, golden slats. Dirt was crusted over the blades like ash. \u201cPolitician\u2014he is fit to be a politician,\u201d Manish was saying to one of his cronies with a big smile, his finger ringed with a thick gold band, pointed at the man in question. Around us, people crowded at tables like insects to light, standing, sitting, one leg on a barstool, one off, arranging garments, checking pockets, checking purses. I saw a man a few tables over bring a hand to the dark space under the table and pull at his crotch. I felt the relief, too. Things falling back into place. I gave a strong imitation of someone who felt comfortable, laughing with all my teeth. Ha, ha, ha. People were dressed in rich colors, burgundy and beige. Hair bouncy, bright with shine or cropped close to the scalp, glistening with stiffness. The seams of their blouses seemed so perfectly snug that it was clear they had been tailored. Some of the women even looked at me. \u201cHey, darling,\u201d they seemed to say. I felt myself harden at just the implication. I was trying to live in the moment more. If I was not thinking about money I was usually thinking about when I would enjoy my next drink. The thirst was tidal, deafening. It flapped wildly in my ears, gave everything a grayish tint that I worried would become permanent, black-and-white vision forever, like a dog\u2019s. I allowed myself one slow breath to focus on what was around me, the promise of a drink close enough to suspend worry. The thought made me suddenly cheerful. Under my own spell, I heard the barroom chatter rise like it was controlled by a volume knob. Once Manish\u2019s various greeters left, he looked at me with the high bite of someone who has been made to look good in public. Out of goodwill and impatience I ordered us a round of vodkas on ice, sliding my card out of its place slowly, carefully, praying Manish would object by presenting his own, but of course, he did not. He kept his gaze firmly in the opposite direction until I asked that the tab stay open. I was not sure if the charge would go through. \u201cI always say,\u201d said Manish, continuing the thread of some conversation that could have been unfolding for some time, \u201cthe last safe place for crooks is India. All of you in America are living on borrowed time.\u201d I did not respond. I had played out the India versus America debate so many times in my mind that I had prevented myself from ever reaching an opinion on the topic. They were both dead ends: that is, places in which you could die if you wanted to. The only difference was that the crooks of one place felt familiar in a way that the other would not, no matter how many elections I voted in or Costco memberships I renewed. I rubbed my palm against my face thoughtfully to avoid having to say anything. \u201cWhy did you come, then?\u201d Manish asked. \u201cHow is Natasha?\u201d From somewhere in his pocket he found a toothpick and took it to his teeth, where he winced and continued to hit a particularly sore region of gum. There was something about it all that endeared him to me, my old friend shading his mouth out of propriety. I felt his bulk, his comfort, his direct questions as a warmth particular to that side of the world. In Bombay every friendship was scintillated by exchanges of information about other people. I did not want to be the wind that blew my own bad news to another man\u2019s ringing telephone. \u201cVacation, brother,\u201d I said. \u201cLook at this liar!\u201d His flat palm clapped suddenly at my cheek. \u201cYou do not have to do all this drama, buddy,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has heard.\u201d I laughed by accident. I had been drinking since ten that morning. \u201cNow, listen,\u201d he said. \u201cListening.\u201d \u201cAre you listening?\u201d I nodded. He leaned in close as if to say something religious. \u201cMove back,\u201d he said, his palm slapping the table for emphasis. \u201cAll your friends are here. You can live in your parents\u2019 old flat, no? I was sorry about your mom\u2019s passing, man. But I am sure the old houseboy will even come back to work for you. What was his name? Chintu? Good fellow. Loyal. Tell me, is it true the apartment is just sitting empty, because if you do not intend to sell it off, I will happily look into it for you. \u201cAre you listening?\u201d he asked again. \u201cListening,\u201d I said. Natasha appeared once more in my vision, that neat trick of marriage, and I looked instinctively at my thigh, knowing how she would commit some violence to my leg under the table if she were here. She never liked Manish. \u201cListen now. Divorce rates are going up here too\u2014every Tom, Dick, and Harry is getting divorced,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of single women.\u201d \u201cWe are not getting divorced,\u201d I said. \u201cBuddy, I heard that she did not even let you come back for your mother\u2019s funeral. Is that true? You missed your own mother\u2019s funeral because of her?\u201d He was speaking very loudly, and I was struck with that old gift of defense I knew so well as a young man. I explained that my oldest daughter had been going through a hard time at school. Natasha had been on the night shift for three months. There were things I needed to take care of at home. I could not have left. \u201cYou are not listening,\u201d he said. \u201cYour chains have been loosened. You are free. I tell you, we were lunatics to get married so young.\u201d I stood up slowly, gesturing to my desire for another drink. The glasses at The Polo Bar were so small. It was a complaint I had heard from my father\u2019s mouth as a child. He was right. Was he always right? Another? I asked Manish with my eyes. I did not mention that I had thought up a plan to deal with my unobliging card. I would keep the tab open, let the card hit the limit, then call the bank in the morning to report the entire transaction as fraud. My wallet was stolen, I would say. Manish gazed into his crystal affectionately. \u201cYou know what,\u201d he shouted as I was halfway to the bar. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Elbows on the counter, I was caught by the arabesque of liquor bottles that made up the far wall of the bar. They reflected the soft overhead light, shades of toffee and chartreuse, twinkling like they were in conversation with one another. To my left and right people were talking. I held the noise of their moving voices as a weight in my ears. Yes, I was suspended somewhere in the black-orange light. A man in limbo, a man with no country. I heard myself order our drinks with the transcontinental twang I usually saved for call centers and air hostesses. I was a man of here, living there. A man of there, visiting here. I wanted everyone to know it: I was a stranger, a guest, an apparition, a man on parole. It was my first time back in ten years and even then, I knew that The Polo Bar would not see my face again for another twenty. I imagined that I would go back to my wife with a fresh beam of light in my eyes. I would swing her leg over my hip. In truth, we had talked about divorce. Some months before my trip, she had poured my last bottle of Stoli down the kitchen sink and I, delirious, childishly hopeful about our situation, spat in her face. It was my fifty-third birthday, and we were back from a party at the neighbor\u2019s. She had worn a velvet dress with red stitching that went to her calves. All evening she was a kind of beautiful dragonfly, passing from group to group with the flutter of one who is liked by people and knows it, swinging out the cake, clapping with her long, almond fingernails. In our own home hours later, she was swinging a knife, screaming into the belly of our hallway that she wanted to stab me. We talked to each other that way sometimes. I did not mind. She came to bed later complaining about the bananas. They were ripening too fast in the heat. The first sunny days of spring. A hatch of small flies were disguising themselves in the spotted peels. You could not see them until you touched the bananas, and then they would fly up in a panic. It was disgusting, she said. She had to throw them all out. We could just live without. I felt the tragedy of this exchange as if she were talking about a child of ours. From the bar I watched the door swing open for a woman in black. She moved like a bride, watchful, her destination clear to herself and those who looked up to watch her. She wore a sleek satin top that fell into folds at her chest, hiding any cleavage, but revealing a set of collarbones strong as branches. There was some hubbub further down the bar where a bearded man had spilled a red drink across his beige trousers. He angrily patted at his crotch with a napkin, emptying his embarrassment on the bartender, who observed from the other side of the counter apologetically. When I looked for the woman again, her jewel-studded hand with its darkly painted fingernails appeared at the back of Manish\u2019s neck, where it pinched the skin lightly. I started to walk over to the table when it occurred to me that it was bad manners not to bring her a drink. I set Manish\u2019s glass down in front of her, knowing he would understand. Her fingers wrapped around the crystal easily. For this, I could tell that she was a woman who knew bad luck. She sipped without making a face. Manish and I looked around the room while she drank, hiding our wonder. As I sipped my own drink, I had a perfect understanding of their romance. He loved her more than she loved him, this woman who was not his wife. I felt a palpable and fast camaraderie with the pair. We were three fools who had failed at marriage. \u201cI would like to play a card game,\u201d I heard myself tell them, a skewered olive bursting bitterly on my tongue. I do not know where my memory goes from there. I see now Manish\u2019s greenish jowls, moving to call my ear to his mouth, instructing me to stick out my tongue with that low whisper he reserved, even in our school days, for shenanigans. There was a blank sensation on my tongue, left there by the tap of his finger. But he could not have given me the tab in the open like that. It would have happened in a bathroom stall or some dark alley. Still, I see us both laughing, gripping each other\u2019s arms in anticipation of the fun we were about to get into, those large fans still above us in the high crescent of my eyeline. I see the woman in black shaking her head disapprovingly, but with that familiar sly smile of amusement that I had seen before on my wife\u2019s face, when our daughters pushed each other around. Then we were all in a rickshaw, headed past Marine Drive, past the Flora Fountain, past a woman wrapped in red fabric sweeping rubbish off her stoop with a broom. She looked calmly at our passing vehicle before adjusting her sari and continuing to sweep. The little car ricketed as though we were traveling over cobblestone. It might even have been the case, some old stone from the nineteenth century. I did not recall looking down to check, but it was not difficult to picture the jackals or even to hear them chirping from a time when much of the city was still an overgrown jungle. I pictured phantom birds, wild things, flowers opening their sugary petals, and then marigold garlands, which were real, drooping from the rain around framed pictures of dead relatives, pictures of goddesses, nailed into arbitrary walls and left for a morning visit. We approached a graying construction with gothic arches and a red, central dome. Something that looked as though it had been clipped and pasted out of a fading European postcard, its stone exterior stolid and bourgeois. The road dipped surreptitiously into a back alley and without warning we were underground. I got a whiff of patchouli and amber, which escaped from the cold wind of the oak door as it opened and closed for other guests. Behind the door was a blank room with a crystal chandelier and intricate paneling, empty aside from a wood desk with a clipboard and a pen. Hearing our noise, two security guards in what seemed to be bulletproof vests stepped in front of us, both of them chewing what I assumed to be paan from the reddish stains on the outer wall. Roughly, they asked Manish what he was looking for. I could hear the steady vibration of Western music coming from further inside. Manish pulled out a card from his wallet to show his membership, which satisfied the two guards. They vetted us by patting our backs, stopping at Manish\u2019s girlfriend, Sonali. \u201cSir, this is a gentleman\u2019s club,\u201d said one of the guards. Manish made a show of digging inside his pocket for something and tucked a few notes into the man\u2019s vest. \u201cThey make you carry weapons and all?\u201d Manish joked to smooth over his bribe. \u201cThis is not an airport, bhai. No terrorists coming here.\u201d By a single touch of his chest the guard could tell how much money Manish had given him. He shot a neutral look at the other guard, whose expression seemed to encourage more haggling. Following a quick dart of whispers between themselves in a dialect I could not identify, they moved aside to let Sonali pass. Manish led us through a dim hallway where all the light was kept out by a thick, burgundy curtain. In the inner room, cheap purple lights twinkled where the ceiling met the walls. There were two makeshift stages with poles and plush chairs around the periphery. A tall woman came to greet us, her palms joined together in a casual namaste. It was only when I heard the gruff bubble of Manish\u2019s laughter that I realized the woman was nearly naked. From the waist down she wore a traditional sari with a thigh-high opening from where a bronzed leg would protrude each time she took a step forward. To cover her breasts she wore a jeweled bra. Her skin appeared lacquered, and it glowed an electric blue under the light. \u201cSome goddess,\u201d Sonali whispered to me. The woman led Manish to a chair in the room, in front of a pole that she prepared to use by undressing from the waist down. Underneath her sari, she wore a gold thong, the strings of which she checked for tightness. There were two other men inside, a father-son duo. Once we were seated, they raised their glasses to us, and Manish called out to them with his usual masculine warmth. \u201cKesai ho, bhai?\u201d The father nodded his head to indicate that he was doing well and invited over a member of the waitstaff. Relieved, I thought I heard him order us a round. His son looked nauseous, either at our presence or his own. He sported a fresh pubescent mustache and a Yankees T-shirt, both of which he fussed with incessantly. Sweating bottles of Kingfisher appeared beside each of us. Looking up, I saw a young woman in a bindi and glasses holding an empty tray. She was dressed in a white shirt and a black vest, though I remember thinking she looked young enough to wear a school uniform. I had the urge to ask how she got caught up in this world. From what I knew of Bombay, you could ask people things like that and they would tell you. They would inch out torn photographs from the folds of their clothing as an explanation, usually a child or a sick mother in some far-off village. I wanted to ask but I was beginning to feel exhausted from our journey. For a moment, I could not remember if I had left my car at The Polo Bar and if I had, as I suspected, forgotten where I parked, I needed to find it at some point. We thanked the man across the room for our drinks. He raised one palm in our direction as a parting greeting. It occurred to me then that he wanted us to continue to exist in the room in our disjointed worlds. The drinks were a promise of that\u2014his own privacy. Time began to disappear, replaced by waves of wanting and unwanting. Wants: a pressure at my lips, my wife\u2019s sleeping body in its curled shape beside me. In my mind I began a conversation with her. I told her that I knew what my problem was, that I had been too happy as a child and had lived my entire adulthood trying to recapture that rapture. And was I sorry for what I did? she would ask. Yes, I was sorry. As the finale of our arguments, she would often assert that I did not consider our family my real family. \u201cYou think your real life is still in India,\u201d she would say. I knew that she did not speak the truth to help me see myself clearly. She told the truth to hurt me, to humiliate me in front of our children. This was the dance of our marriage, and so I would put out a hand for the waltz. \u201cThis is not a home,\u201d I said to her during one of these fights. \u201cThis is temporary for all of us.\u201d The fizz of beer rose in my mouth; in it, I tasted the black tongue of our arguments. On the other makeshift stage, where the boy and his father were sitting, a shining, lilac woman crawled around the floor. At our stage, the gold woman\u2019s eyes became a clothesline connecting to Manish. I figured she could tell he was the only one among us with money. I thought about the exchange rate, if Manish was putting exactly seventy-four rupees between the string and her skin. \u201cI heard you are getting bored,\u201d Sonali said to me. I motioned for her to repeat herself into my ear. The speaker vibrations overpowered the melody of whatever song was playing. \u201cI heard you are getting divorced.\u201d I told her that I was still married, that I intended to stay that way. \u201cMe too,\u201d she smiled, her breath gingery and bright. She turned the diamond around from the inside of her palm and presented her left hand to me. It was a modest ring, an old-fashioned band. The setting had been popular in the nineties, thick gold with a smattering of small diamonds. My father had specialized in it back when his shop was still open: The Bridal Set. The bestseller, the winner, the one that paid the bills. When my father sold his first, we celebrated with a duty-free bottle of Moet & Chandon. I was not much of a joker, never the funny guy, but I instinctively jabbed Manish in the arm. \u201cCongratulations, yaar,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could not buy her a better ring? This design is thirty years old.\u201d Manish dismissed my comment with a sharp shake of his head; he was focused on some trick the woman in gold was performing with a lollipop. Sonali put a hand on my chin. For some reason I felt that I was the one who was undressed. \u201cNot him!\u201d she said. \u201cI am married to Rohit Shetty.\u201d \u201cThe real estate guy?\u201d She nodded. \u201cIs not he in jail?\u201d She looked down at her hands, her ring shining like a berry. I knew jail, I wanted to say. When you are at the bottom you come to know all the dark places that you thought were only for other people. In fact they are for everyone. They welcome you. You are in them before you know it. But it was not the time to talk about myself. I felt Manish\u2019s eyes on us and when I turned to face him he took one of Sonali\u2019s cheeks between his thumb and index finger. He kissed her with a splotch on the mouth. I pretended to be engrossed by the woman on the pole, knowing I would not get aroused with a teenage boy in my eyeline. I watched his hand flutter to the lobe of his ear, his gaze zip between his crotch and his father, parsing out the correct behavior for a situation like this. I thought then that maybe we did not like ourselves very much. I tried to catch the boy\u2019s eye so we could share something, some wave of discomfort, a shrug, and that was when Manish stood up and walked to the front of the stage. With a curled finger, he called the woman from her high place on the pole. She faced away from Manish and bent down so that she was on her hands and knees. He raised his hand to touch her, but a man\u2019s voice erupted from the back room. \u201cNo touching!\u201d It was the security guard from earlier. He approached the stage with a baton in hand. \u201cNo touching?\u201d Sonali and I watched as Manish grabbed the woman with his right hand. She let out a shriek and it felt like a glass prism had shattered somewhere in the room. The guards rushed over to Manish and held his two limbs apart as he struggled against them. They waited for the woman in gold to have her revenge: she caught Manish by the collar and channeled her twenty-something years into a gorgeous, crystalline glob of spit. They hit him once to stop him from struggling and I, with my misplaced righteousness, stood up to help my friend. For several minutes they were on both of us, and we ended up on the ground, fighting, audibly cursing each other for our stupidity. Once the commotion flatlined, a high whistle began to sound in my ear. Or maybe it did not happen like that. Maybe it was something else that bruised my ribs. But I remembered the woman\u2019s voice, calling the guard by his first name for help. Ashwin, Ashwinder, one of those godly names. Manish\u2019s lower lip had swollen into a fig and Sonali kept her gaze fixed outside the window of our cab. The shifting navy screen of nighttime, copper and crystal lights. Manish asked her to take a look at his mouth. He held it to her eyes, a chubby finger pointing at the damage. \u201cYou act like a donkey, you are going to get treated like one,\u201d she said. There was a lull, sounds of traffic, a series of gated apartment buildings. I felt the faint pulsing of blood in my ear, though I was too afraid to touch it, in case I was left with a profile of mangled flesh. \u201cNow we do what he wants to do,\u201d Manish said. It was an instruction to the cab driver, who turned around and looked at me. I was humming an old Bollywood love song that my mother would often sing after dinner, when she took a knife to the spotted skin of a pear for our dessert. I aimed my humming at Sonali, who knew the tune immediately. O heart, take me to the alleys, The streams of love, I have gotten lost, Looking at the moon, Waiting for her to come back. We sang together in the backseat of the cab and a silver thrill flashed and disappeared between us. I heard myself guiding the driver about where to go with Manish\u2019s interjections. When we arrived, twin gates swung open to let us in. A security guard in a blue uniform, delight across his face, walked us into the marble foyer, past a placard the size of a billboard listing last names and apartment numbers. We were headed to 5A and everyone seemed to know, though no one had to say it. The elderly elevator attendant called me by my name. \u201cWell,\u201d he said to Sonali in Hindi, \u201cthey are men now. I have been here since they were this small.\u201d His flat palm shot down to his waist for a visual representation. We all breathed loudly, the lobes of our ears red. The apartment door was open, or at least I did not remember hearing a click at the keyhole. I could not tell you how many people were present, how many of them rushed to the door to greet us, making a commotion of our chests and cheeks with their hands. I could not tell you if it was real. But I remember that I was presented with a toffee-colored dachshund who yapped into my hair. Manish switched on lights that glowed from the two baby chandeliers, illuminating a room heavy with the thick, hot haze of men drinking. I saw that there were two tables set up: one for food and one for a game of cards. I pulled out a chair at the first table, settling the dog in my lap, and found myself face to face with an uninspiring cucumber salad. Beside me there seemed to be an old woman counting cash. She looked up with indifference and I thought it was strange how closely she resembled my mother. She was dressed in a Victorian nightgown, her long gray hair in a thin braid that hung by her waist. I knew the texture of her at once: the straw hair, the pilly cloth, the perfect white crescents of her fingernails. I wanted to hear her voice. I asked her what was in the salad. \u201cArr\u00e9 Chintu!\u201d she yelled into the sky. \u201cInside salad, what is?\u201d An irritated young man scurried from the kitchen, his hands wet from the still-running tap. In English, he began reciting the ingredients, counting them off on his fingers: \u201cCucumber, mint, pear, apple, honey, watermelon.\u201d \u201cIt is a fruit salad,\u201d the woman clarified matter-of-factly. \u201cPlease eat. All day you have not eaten.\u201d I watched her fingers swipe bill after bill, the freckles of old age dusted across her arms. Surely it was my mother, dead now for over a year. I nodded at her to seem calm and wondered how long I could continue to sit there without somebody asking me to introduce myself. From inside the kitchen, Manish brought me a glass of something pink, a sweet foam nearly running off the brim. \u201cIt is really hitting me now,\u201d he said. I remembered then that we had taken something before we left The Polo Bar. Its consequences were concentrated in my eyeballs. Across the room, chairs scraped the floors pink as the poker table was set up. The salad was plump, squealing things I could not understand. I remembered feeling a deep sadness that everything in the world was not painted green, the best color. I hungered for green. The gift of sunlight flecked on leaves, the pale chartreuse of American money. People kept patting me on the back, saying that it was good to see me. \u201cGood to see you, Tiger,\u201d they said. Some of them had long, naughty anecdotes from when we were in school together. Me, the backbencher, bribing lecture proctors to count me as present when I was anything but. What was I even doing? No one knew. I would just disappear, they said; it was a miracle I ever graduated. I asked whose house we were in, but even at this they laughed. I thought the dachshund laughed at me too, but she had only raised her small skull to observe the noise before letting it settle again on her front paws. I felt unwelcome, annoyed that everyone behaved as if they knew something I did not. I looked at the old woman with a blank face, like I was in on the joke, and she smiled back at me warmly. \u201cEat something,\u201d she urged again. She pushed a plate towards me, thumped a helping of salad on its side. It was usually impossible to negotiate with women like her\u2014benevolent party ghosts who force-fed guests until they begged for peace. There was one of them in every old apartment. I complimented the food after my first bite and removed myself from her reach. On the far end of the room, Sonali was running a hand over the woodwork on one of the cabinets. I had watched a YouTube documentary about her husband\u2019s arrest. The courts were auctioning off their various properties: the Dubai villa, the Alibaug farmhouse, the Bandra bungalow. She saw me see her, and a thought we shared told me that she was remembering the house she once lived in. I imagined it to be eclectic but classic, like her, something with many unsuspecting antiques mixed with modern pieces, good art, chestnut floors. I could tell from the envy with which she eyed those old cabinets that the sadness she carried was new. I took the dog to her as a silent offering but she recoiled at the sight of its tongue, afraid. She was never one for small creatures, she explained, ordering me to take it away. Standing next to her, I became aware that I was newly damp between my legs. My first thought was menstrual blood, but then I remembered that that could not be. I took the dog with me to the closest bathroom, a dark, high-ceilinged space with a black toilet. For several moments as I undid the buttons of my jeans, I considered the possibility that my body was changing, that I was being sucked into a deep, emerald hell. I held onto the wall, frightened, certain that I would not be strong enough to withstand any sort of karmic wind. The oculus in the ceiling appeared to open briefly and I felt tremendous shame standing there as the universe opened up before me in my underwear. I shook myself dry and took the dachshund to my breast. The pictures on the wall were in shades of sepia and gray, posed photographs of a young woman, her bouffant stiff as a lampshade, holding a bundle of cloth to her neck. A baby. In another photo, a man with a furrowed brow carried the child, older then, on his shoulders. I was looking at the pictures when Sonali came in. \u201cPrincess!\u201d she said to the dog, refusing to hold her again. I showed her what I saw, expecting her to provide me with some history. Her hand was on my back. She asked if I knew that the lady\u2019s husband died in a terrible accident some years before. He had drowned. \u201cDrowned?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe was a drunk,\u201d Sonali said. \u201cHe tried to go swimming.\u201d She leaned against the sink, produced a cigarette from somewhere in her pants, and brought a flame to her face with the nonchalance of an old habit. A velvety puff of smoke surrounded us. I let the dachshund out. Wanting to fill the silence, I asked Sonali to tell me something surprising. She said there was another man in the picture, a man other than Manish, other than her husband. He lived in London. I thought, wow. It was my turn and I shared that I had kissed a man once, during a dry phase of much rejection from both employers and women. I was twenty-one, newly anointed with a bachelor\u2019s degree in management science, though I was not ready to manage anything yet. And did I enjoy it? she asked. I confessed that I did, though I did not know it myself for some time. Unprompted, Sonali began to talk about her husband. She said it was an open relationship now, that she was not doing anything wrong. \u201cRohit always had his whores,\u201d she said. I wanted her to say more but I knew that anything she said would depress me. Talking about other couples was always a dangerous game; either they made you think you could have done better for yourself, found someone as good for you as they were for each other, or that you could have been better for your wife, which was always true. But she still loved him, she admitted. She believed he was innocent. \u201cI do not think he is,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was convicted.\u201d Then she stopped talking. We listened together to the insects outside, who said things we could not understand. I could hear them in color: brilliant pinks and oranges, chirping, chatting out in the wind. I knew I was hallucinating only when I began to hear a sitar track the melody of the song we were singing earlier. Sonali looked at me like she understood what was happening, like she heard it too. \u201cRelax,\u201d she said. There was her hand again, making a generous circle on my back. I wanted to put my arm around her, this firestarting woman. I let her kiss me, let her guide my hand to her thin, silky underthings, then down, down, where her legs were parted slightly in anticipation. Kissing her was extraordinarily loud, like moving furniture. I had the instinct to swallow her whole. I looked into the great glistening mound of her, the reddened mouth, the spidery lashes, the hint of an Adam\u2019s apple. The growing redness of her inner thigh, where my belt had hit up against some thin but strong bone. I was grateful. I had not touched a woman other than my wife in twenty-seven years. She moaned so sweetly in my ear that I heard it as a chord. I had another drink. I felt I had some business to complete at the pool. I knew where the pool would be from the way the bodies in the apartment craned their white necks out and down from the balcony. I took the stairs to the ground floor, expected and received a whiff of Dettol past the changing rooms. I cannot explain how I knew it would be there, that black rectangle of stillwater, shining under the moonlight like a sheet of metal. I took off a shoe and threw it in to make sure it was all real. It was. The splash untied some taut ribbon deep in my abdomen and before I could think, I had taken one step and then another, laughing at myself. The water was warm. Tenderly, it pulled me in, set alight a coolness in my scalp. In the center of the glowing orange square of the fifth floor, I watched Sonali\u2019s body waver with the dachshund in her arms. I knew that she recognized me from her great height, and I wanted to return the comfort. I waved to her: an invitation. There was the sound of thunder from somewhere far away. Would it rain? At first I felt fear for the weather, for the gossip, for the state of my marriage, but beneath it, growing, I sensed the spread of a stony new calm. I had an ancient impulse that knew this building, knew this water. I knew I had seen it all before as a child. I had jumped off the diving board. I had touched the bottom tile. I swam out to the middle of the pool and dove under. The string of an old memory came to me, but I could not catch it. In the deep, the water was colder. It separated me from myself, dulled the crescents of my fingertips. I imagined that I was all gone, one with the black. There was no skin, no cloth that made me different from this, the dark. I thought I saw a glint of something silver float close to my face and flicker away. It looked like the long, gray hairs of an old woman. I put my hands out for her to come again but she did not. Above water, the thunder sounded again. It belted gently, muffled like words from another language. The salt of hot tears ringed my eyes. Not even our memories came back when we wanted them to. I felt a rising froth of longing for my mother and then hands, pulling me up, quick, by the collar.",
    "Moving,Pictures": "Spring, 1919 Soon, she will leave. But now, she is tired. As the oldest daughter, the only daughter, she has spent years carrying her brothers on her back. She is seventeen. Her spine is already crooked. Before she was born, her father named her Yamul, literally adept, nimble and competent, like a prophecy or an expectation. She is not sorry to leave him behind. She is not sorry to leave Yamul behind, the name and the expectation, the laundry and the dishes. She will leave behind the house and the men, her father and her brothers, bothersome and bottomless, always breaking, always helpless, always opening their arms to be held, always opening their mouths to be fed. In the morning, her father tries to stop her. He rushes to the shipyard after he wakes up to a house that smells empty \u2013 no kimchee, no tea. He drags along two clumsy-fingered brothers. But he is too late. All three stand at the pier by the barge. She is already standing on the ship\u2019s wooden deck. They look up at her and she looks down at them. The men seem small. \u201cYamul, we love you,\u201d her father says. \u201cCome home.\u201d She just grins, white teeth, lipstick. That afternoon, she watches the green land quietly collapse, shrivel, until she is surrounded by blue crinkled ocean and everything she knows is gone. She imagines she is leaving herself, too, leaving Yamul, the obedient, adept daughter. She is someone new now, a woman reborn in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The trip from Korea to Hawaii takes weeks. She soon meets her bunkmate, a frail sixteen-year-old. Each night her bunkmate gets sick all over the floor, drunk on the ship\u2019s rocking. The beds are wooden here, cold, and the rice is never cooked properly. She is stranded in the middle of an unending ocean, one stretches blue and blank into the sky, and the journey is beginning to feel long. Thirteen days into the voyage, her bunkmate shows her pictures. A man stands in black-and-white, a little blurry. \u201cHe is so handsome,\u201d her bunkmate says reverently. \u201cYes,\u201d she agrees. \u201cHe has a Rolls Royce,\u201d her bunkmate says. She turns. \u201cAnd what about yours, then? Handsome too?\u201d Yamul has two pictures of her future husband. In one, he is standing by a car, black, expensive. In the other, he is standing by a house, white, also expensive. He is attractive, maybe twenty or twenty-one years old, too much hair. Later, history textbooks will mention her in their margins. The textbooks will call her a picture bride, because she is crossing an ocean to marry a man who she has only seen in photographs. She knows her husband\u2019s name, and she knows he works in the sugarcane plantations. And she knows that if she had stayed in Korea, she would have been married off by her father. This man she chose herself, all on her own, isolated, and she could have even refused him. She had seen him, him with his hair, car, crooked grin, and she had decided that she was in love. She had sent back two of her own photos, one with her hair tied up prettily and one where she stood in a white slip. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. She grins. \u201cHe is handsome.\u201d Summer, 1919 Her first taste of America is a vagueness in the distance. The young women go above deck to watch the land take shape. It comes grey and humid. They dock, anchor. The stillness of the boat unnerves her. She is hurried off the ship, together with the other brides. The women are hustled into a building. One by one, they step up to an upright white box and a man instructs them to sign a marriage license. They each have one \u2013 one per bride. When it is her turn, she signs, and then the man places one lukewarm hand atop hers to get her attention. He points to the door. She walks outside. She is an American now, a married bride. This is her wedding day, and it is time to meet her husband. The brides walk to meet their grooms. Someone taps her on her shoulder. She turns and sees a man. He says something to her. \u201cNo English,\u201d she says brokenly. \u201cYou undersold yourself,\u201d he says in Korean. He is middle-aged. He is balding. \u201cI do not understand,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are more beautiful than the photos.\u201d Then he smiles crookedly, and she suddenly understands that this man is supposed to be her husband. She is shocked. He looks more like her father than he looks like the man in the photograph. She looks at him, his plain old face, his plain old suit. He must be twenty years older than her. She feels sick. She feels cheated. This is not the man she loves. Later, the history textbooks that call her a picture bride will say, the men lied in the photos. They will say, the men were desperately poor. The picture bridegrooms posed with rich friends\u2019 cars or sent photographs from thirty years ago. In reality they are bald. In reality they are in debt. Marooned, the brides, locked to these old, broke, lying men, will be forced to work the plantations until their hands break and bleed. Soon enough, this whole textbook future will unfold beneath her like prophecy, like paper. But she does not know it. All she knows is that the boat has already left. The man takes her to his house. It is squashed, cabbage-colored. They are beside the plantations, dry fields that stretch like tangled hair. He fumbles with the key. He opens the door. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cWelcome home.\u201d She walks inside and surveys the small space quietly. There is a single bed. There is a sink, a toilet, a kettle. She feels a hand on her back. She looks up and her husband pushes her towards the bed. She falls quietly onto the covers and stares at the ceiling. He begins to kiss her. He is not a good kisser. There is too much wet. He is a little fat under his suit, too. And she can feel how much he wants her. She is young, beautiful, red-lipped. He has been in this vacant place with no women for too long, all alone, and he needs a woman to love him. After a few minutes, he pulls away, reluctant. \u201cYou are so pretty,\u201d he says. \u201cYamul.\u201d She is shocked. She opens her eyes, sees white wall. \u201cYou know my name,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d she asks. Her husband looks at her like she is a strange and foreign creature, something to handle cautiously. \u201cYou know my name too,\u201d he says. \u201cDo not you?\u201d She falls quiet now, feeling stupid, because she does know his name, and it seems only logical that he might know hers as well. Still, though, this somehow feels like the ultimate betrayal, him knowing her in all her daughterhood and adeptness. She had crossed an ocean to escape its prickly, inevitable grasp. And now here he is, her husband, pudgy, ugly, desperate, with no hair, with too many teeth. He will ask her for food, he will ask to be held. She will need to clean this house. Even in America, she is only Yamul. Fall, 1919 They have fallen in debt to the plantation store. They have fallen in debt to the neighbors. Her husband is a gambler and an addict, which disgusts her, but then again all the men are. It is expensive, the alcohol, the opium. She has to protect what little money she has left. Her name is still Yamul, and she still does not speak English. Today she wakes up at night, dark everywhere, and she changes into crisp clothing, the fabric stiff from too many washings. She labors in the sugarcane plantations, alongside her husband, both of them on the owners\u2019 clock. The day is made of knuckles and it passes in tangled, swollen hours. She keeps her head to the dirt and she works adeptly, competently. She has no other choice. When she gets home her hands are tacky. She licks one palm, experimental, and she tastes sweat, sugar, blood. She cooks dinner, rice and pork, cheap and hot. She and her husband eat quietly, quickly, chopsticks always halfway to their mouths. Afterwards her husband steps back from the table and presses into her, soft. She let us him do it. They fall onto the bed. They have had sex twice in their marriage, both times awkward. Now he hovers over her in the dark. She goes very still, almost stiff. \u201cRelax,\u201d he breathes into her ear. \u201cJust relax already.\u201d \u201cI am relaxed,\u201d she says. \u201cNo, you are not,\u201d he says. Everywhere around them is dark. She is worn-out, tired. She has worked all day. She turns slowly around, so that they face each other, knee bones clicking together. His eyes are wide and black in the dark. \u201cI cannot do it, Yamul,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know that. I cannot do it until you are relaxed.\u201d \u201cI do not understand,\u201d she says. \u201cI am relaxed.\u201d But she does not move or unclench. She just looks at him with big, innocent eyes and waits. With one fist he hits the thin comforter. He groans, his big body softening under him. He is like a child. \u201cYou are turning me off,\u201d he whines. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery night,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery night, you sit there, so still. You think I do not know what you are trying to do?\u201d \u201cI am confused,\u201d she says. He looks at her, still halfway lustful. \u201cI am your husband,\u201d he spits. \u201cDo you know that? I am your husband.\u201d Back in Korea, her father liked to say that love is something that emerges between a husband and his wife after they are married. Love, in her father\u2019s mind, is just another expectation. And she is Yamul, adept. She has grown accustomed to providing men with expected things. She cooks rice and sweeps floors and leaves the fields with hands stained with blood. She opens her arms to her husband. She feeds him. But he is not the man in the photograph. She does not feel love. Winter, 1919 On an October night, her husband gambles and fails. He comes home insecure, needy, drunk. He staggers into the house, shuts the door, fiddles with the lock. It is two or three of the clock in the morning. She is already in bed. He comes and lays down next to her. \u201cYamul,\u201d he says, cotton mouth breath. \u201cYou are awake, are not you.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly. She hears him sigh. Drunkenly he reaches out a hand, too warm. He strokes down her arm tenderly, feeling its fine hairs, caressing the soft envelope of her elbow. She wonders momentarily if he is trying to ask for sex. But he does not move past her arm. For five minutes they stay like this, breathing together, him stroking her. Then she finally turns to face him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d he asks. He studies her. She does not say anything. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cI will stop.\u201d Now he pulls his hands away. He turns from her, so that he lays on his back. He looks up at the white ceiling. She glances at his face. \u201cWhat is going on with you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are acting strange.\u201d \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not know. I am sorry.\u201d She is quiet now. In seven months of rotten, miserable marriage, she has never heard him apologize before. She stares at her husband like he has become a foreign person. He is still staring up at the ceiling. Slowly she notices that his eyes are wet. He is almost crying. She notices this dispassionately. Maybe he is upset about the gambling, maybe he is just too drunk. Maybe it is something else. She finds that she does not particularly care. \u201cI am so in love with you,\u201d he says, sudden and unexpected. \u201cI am so in love, Yamul.\u201d She pauses. She does not know how to respond. She does not understand how he could have grown to love her when she feels nothing but coldness towards him. He turns to her. He is crying now, fully crying, and it looks terrible. Tears dribble from his eyes onto his cheeks. His nose is running. She leans away. \u201cGod, why do not you love me,\u201d he says, helpless, fishlike. \u201cI am your husband. Shit, you are supposed to love me.\u201d She is silent. Slowly he begins to calm himself down. He settles into the covers and sniffs wetly. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease.\u201d He opens his fat arms to be held. And this is something she has done before, this is something she knows. She does it quickly, competently. When she reaches him he grasps onto her, sloppy, too tight. He winds his arms around her and rocks her body drunkenly. She let us it happen out of obligation alone. She does not complain. She listens as his breath slows. Eventually he tires, and he let us go of her, and they both fall back into the bed. Tonight her husband is melancholic, depressed. Tomorrow she will wake up and find that he has lost more of their money. They will not have enough to buy pork for dinner. She will serve rice in chipped bowls. Soon, she knows, too soon, he will run out of things to gamble. Spring, 1920 It is a Saturday evening when they finally lose the last of their money. They are at the neighbors\u2019 place, a party. The husbands are drinking, gambling. The wives sit on the couch like porcelain. Cards lay scattered across the table. The men are on the second or third round of their game, but her husband has lost every hand. Her husband empties his pockets of pennies. The other men take the coins, slipping them into fat pockets. \u201cYou out yet?\u201d one of the men asks her husband drunkenly, in Korean. \u201cNo, no,\u201d her husband says. \u201cNot yet.\u201d \u201cWell, what do you want to bet then?\u201d the man asks. \u201cIf you have even got anything left.\u201d Her husband looks down at the table. He splays his fingers, touches the edge of a playing card. He glances up at her. He grins. \u201cHer,\u201d he says. \u201cYour wife?\u201d the other man snorts. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. He nods to her. He grins wider. \u201cC\u2019mere, Yamul. Stand up.\u201d She is sitting at the couch, the other women beside her. Quiet. Her knees pressed together. Palms on her thighs. She looks up at her husband, still and silent. He looks back at her with black, glassy eyes. \u201cPretty, is not she?\u201d her husband says. \u201cPlay your cards right, and maybe you can win her love.\u201d The men laugh. It is a joke. They leave quickly. Outside, it is raining. Her husband is drunk out of his mind. As they walk back home, she feels fat raindrops slide from her hair to her cheeks. Soon they are both drenched. They make their way to their porch and begin to climb up the stairs. Before he opens the door, her husband pauses. He turns towards her. He brings one hand up to her face, cups her chin, and she looks back at him, hollow. For a minute they both stand there in the deluge, rain everywhere, his drunken breath five and a half inches from her throat. \u201cGod,\u201d he says casually. \u201cThank God I did not actually lose you, huh?\u201d Now he steps closer. He presses his lips into hers. She feels empty. She does not resist. They kiss for thirty-eight seconds. She counts them, wet heartbeats. He pulls away. He grins. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says. Her father said this too. Her husband pauses. He studies her, then pats her cheek. \u201cAw, you are mad,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cDo not be mad. It was a joke.\u201d \u201cI am not mad,\u201d she says coldly. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d he says. She looks up at her husband, and then she looks through him. For a moment she thinks about running away. But she knows that she will not. This story already has an ending. Her story has had an ending before she was even born. She stands alone in the rain. Her husband is next to her. Or maybe he is not. Maybe she is not even here. Maybe she is still in Korea. Maybe she never even left. Her husband grabs her arm. She looks into his fat eyes. He has been talking. She has no idea what he has been saying. \u201cWait, actually, are you mad?\u201d he asks. \u201cYamul. I am sorry. Are you mad?\u201d Later, the textbooks will call her a picture bride. The text will say, she could not leave. Then the paragraph will break, and the textbooks will not say anything else. They will not explain why she cannot leave. It is because these small technicalities, every whisper and rule and name that constrains her, do not warrant the space. There are more compelling and more important things for men to remember. She will only exist for a quarter of a margin. In some textbooks, she will not exist at all. She has spent her life existing in spaces that are too small for her. She is not the first woman tangled in the prophecies of men. But in the dark with her forlorn husband, she only finds herself smiling. She is grinning now. She is grinning because she has won. Men, husbands, fathers, brothers, reach to her helplessly, always broken, always hungry, always desperate for rice and love. She will feed them. But she will never love them. Yamul feels the rainwater fill her mouth. She imagines it is ocean on her tongue.",
    "LosAngelesBarCrawl": "1. He begins in a bar in Santa Monica in the early evening, a gastropub that serves burgers and beer, though he only has beer, first a lager from a local brewery that he finds a little too light and fruity and then a pale ale modeled on something from England, which has a nice caramel bitterness that leaves him feeling pleasantly at ease, as if he will sink into the cushion on his seat and get swallowed up by the soft fabric. On the patio across from him, facing the street and illuminated by the passing headlights, sit three guys about ten years younger than him, somewhere in their early twenties, talking excitedly and laughing wildly and slapping each other on the back, a field of empty glasses spread out on the table between them. They make Ahmed think of his own friends from college, how they used to go to bars like this one, the effortlessness of conversation, walking home afterwards and feeling as if life would always be this way. He finishes his last beer in one long bitter swig and then signals the waitress for the check. Above him, the sky is turning red with the sinking sun. 2. Next, he takes the metro all the way downtown, deciding on a whim to go to a brewery in the Arts District where he used to go all the time when he lived on that side of the city. It is a large space in a converted warehouse, and by the time he arrives the sun has set, and the red brick building looks striking against the dark sky, the neon sign making him feel a jolt in his chest, reminding him of days years ago now, when he and Amy would come here and sit in a corner booth for hours, talking and laughing with the easy banter of a new relationship, then stumble out, hand in hand, kissing in the warm night as they waited at street corners for the light to change or in the doorways of office buildings, their bodies pressed against the dark glass. But now, when he goes inside, he feels a strange loneliness. The bar is crowded, and he has trouble signaling the waiter, and when he finally orders, his earlier buzz is gone, and he feels a headache coming on from the back of his neck. He drinks his beer quickly while standing at the bar, an IPA that he finds a little too strong. Afterwards he orders a Belgian sour and sips it slowly while checking his phone, feeling self conscious that he is the only person here by himself and trying not to stare at the couple across the bar, both of them older than he is but gazing into each other\u2019s eyes with a passion that he has not felt for a long, long time. On his phone, he pulls up the email he sent earlier to the tutoring company where he worked, subject line \u201cTwo Weeks Notice.\u201d He would asked them to raise his pay rate but they would refused, citing budgetary issues. It is a tough economic time. We all have to make sacrifices. In a rage, he would quit, sending the email before he could second guess himself. Now, in the dim light, pop music from his childhood playing over the speakers and echoing off the exposed pipes and the high ceiling, he wonders if it was the right decision. He has nothing else lined up, no private tutoring clients, no freelance writing gigs\u2014just a modest savings account that likely will not last more than a few months. He puts his phone away and finishes his beer and then signals the bartender for the check. 3. From there, he walks downtown, stops at a taco truck for a quick dinner, and then on a whim ducks into a cocktail bar on the ground floor of an expensive hotel, a narrow, rectangular space with dim lighting emanating from low hanging chandeliers and a chessboard wall that gives the place the vibe of a children\u2019s dollhouse. It is packed with men and women in business suits here for an after-work drink, and Ahmed hears snippets of conversation about project deadlines and HR departments. The sole, overworked bartender is a guy in a stylish button-down and skinny jeans who looks like he plays bass in a band part time. Ahmed feels a twinge of sympathy for someone pursuing an artistic career like himself, before remembering that he himself has not written anything for years, not since his literary agent dropped him after the novel he would written failed to get picked up by a major publisher. He orders a daiquiri, which is the special that night, and he finds it surprisingly good, so much so that he orders two more and drinks them relatively quickly. Now he is very drunk, and he leaves the bar in a haze, stumbling past a group of women in pantsuits who give him a concerned look, the lights of the chandeliers at once too bright and too dim. 4. He can go home now, back to his apartment, watch a T.V. show or an old movie, or just masturbate to some porn and then go to bed, but now that he is drunk, he is decided why not stay out celebrate quitting his job, his fucking job that he never liked anyway\u2014so he takes an Uber to Silver Lake and goes to a bar on Sunset, a hipster place with lots of people his age, women in stylish denim and leather jackets, men in patterned half-sleeve button downs, everyone drinking cocktails and talking in California accents, the familiar rhythm of millennial upspeak that once again makes him think of his life years before, when he would first moved to LA and gone out in groups like the ones he saw at the tables around him, having serious conversations about books and writing and art. But when he sits down in a corner table and sips the old fashioned he is ordered through a plastic straw, all he can think of is how he came here with Amy, after they were married, in those honeymoon years, how they sat at this very table, leaned close, the scent of her perfume clouding out all other scents, her voice drowning out all other voices. Now all he can do is concentrate on those other voices, each one reminding him of Amy. He opens up Facebook on his phone before remembering that she does not have a profile, and this leaves him wondering what her life is like now, whether she is happy, or whether she cries at night like he does, whether she sits in her new apartment and remembers the night they would decided to divorce, that terrible night under the glaring lights of their kitchen, their voices hoarse from another long fight, Amy\u2019s eyes red with tears, her repeated declarations \u201cI cannot do this anymore\u201d and \u201cYou have become so bitter and angry\u201d echoing in his ears. That all happened a year ago, but tonight in the bar he thinks of it like it was yesterday, and he is so overwhelmed with sadness that he only has this one drink, and afterwards stumbles out into the street, shielding his eyes from the glare of the streetlamp. 5. He walks for a while, back down Sunset and towards downtown, and in Echo Park he ducks into a dive bar that he remembers going to once with his old friend Veronica, who died in a car crash two years ago. She would been complaining about her girlfriend Rebecca, how they would tried to do an open relationship but how it had left them so bitter and jealous, but in those years, because Ahmed and Amy were happy, all Ahmed did was offer tepid words of comfort. Now, he sits at the bar, his elbows accidentally resting in a puddle of beer, a soggy receipt for over $100 clinging to his jacket. He orders a shot of whiskey and drinks it quickly, but instead of ordering another, he thinks of Veronica, how sudden the news was, how guilty he would felt for not reaching out before. He worries he would been a bad friend when she would needed him most. 6. From there,he takes an Uber to the Miracle Mile and eats a burrito at a stand he remembered going to years ago\u2014then afterwards he wanders into a new brewery that is just opened up, in an old car dealership, an old-fashioned modernist building that dates back to the 1950s. It is an awe inspiring, incredible place, high ceilings, loud music, bright lights, people everywhere, but behind them, Ahmed can still envision the car dealership as it once was, the places on the tiled floor where the salesmen\u2019s desks would have sat, the center platform where a glamorous new model might be displayed, the walls with faded marks where advertisements must have hung\u2014all of it now disappeared, a prior century transformed by the brutal progress of history. Everyone is so young here, he notices, so young, in white t-shirts that cling to their perfect bodies, crop tops showing off their flat stomachs, high waisted jeans that look as elegant as evening dresses on their lithe bodies, everyone dancing wildly, pounding shots, yelling at each other over the electronic tracks, making out in corner tables, touching each other on the shoulders and the waists and the chests even while they wait at the bar to order. Ahmed squeezes through the throng and orders a beer and a whiskey and then goes outside and sits at a table. Out here it is still crowded, people smoking cigarettes and clustered around the small tables, laughter piercing the night in sharp spears of sound, but the music is dampened by the thick walls of the old building, and the cool night air feels refreshing against his skin. He sips his beer and stares at the row of buildings across the busy street, the palm trees silhouetted behind them looking to him like figures on a Grecian urn, cracked, faded, but somehow still surviving even after all these years. 7. He takes the bus from the car dealership to Culver City, feeling relaxed in the front seat, leaning his head back against the glass, the up and down rhythm of the bus strangely soothing to his stomach. When he disembarks, he walks for a bit before going into a karaoke bar that he would gone to with Amy for one of her friend\u2019s birthdays, a small place in a strip mall that makes him think of the suburb where he grew up. He does not sing anything tonight but instead just sits at the bar, orders a simple lager, and listens while an Indian-American guy his age sings a song that Ahmed remembers listening to in high school, crooning out the melody with a heartfelt intensity and then ending with a bow to wild applause from the crowd. 8. From there, Ahmed walks for a while, down Venice Boulevard, the cars drifting by on his left, their headlights shimmering in the darkness, the palm trees and power lines swaying in the wind as if the whole world is slowly moving back and forth around him. Eventually, he reaches an old, speakeasy-themed bar, the sign glowing in the dark like a familiar landmark on a long stretch of highway. It is past midnight now, and the place is mostly empty, but it will be open for another two hours, and there are regulars there sitting alone at tables or at the bar in pairs, talking quietly while soft jazz plays. Ahmed knows the wood paneling is probably no older than a decade, but he likes to imagine it is been salvaged from an actual speakeasy, a bar from the 1880s that somehow survived Prohibition but then shuttered in the 1980s in the face of global capitalism. He sits on a stool at the bar and orders a brandy, which he drinks slowly, trying to savor the taste. He thinks about his novel, a multigenerational family saga which had begun in the early 20th century, part one a story of his grandfather\u2019s life in Pakistan. He would researched it so meticulously, looking at old photographs, spending hours at the library reading books and newspaper articles, making timelines at his desk at home, posters pasted to the wall with all the complex politics he would hoped to capture. But for whatever reason, he would missed something\u2014something fundamental in the story, some kind of heart. 9. He takes an Uber back towards his apartment in West LA, but decides last minute to go to one final bar in Westwood, a place he would once frequented as a student at UCLA, the kind of establishment that did not card and served cheap beer in pitchers and had big T.V.s that always broadcast ESPN. At this time of night, it is still crowded with students. Ahmed sits at the bar and orders a beer and then notices a student beside him, talking animatedly to his friend, a brown guy just like him, perhaps Indian or Pakistani, but possibly Middle Eastern or Iranian too. It is hard to hear exactly what they are talking about, and Ahmed catches only snippets, but what is more important is the way the guy looks\u2014there is an earnestness in his expression, his wide eyes, his open mouth, the purity of simple and straightforward excitement. As with all brown guys his age, Ahmed feels a slight tinge of recognition, wondering at which points their experiences mirrored each other\u2014but he also cannot remember the last time he would been so earnest about anything, the last time he would had that kind of look in his eyes. Even in that final year with Amy, he would been so jaded, so angry, decrying the publishing industry, decrying the world. Perhaps that was why she left, he suddenly thinks. 10. At home, he grabs a beer from his fridge and then sits at the bar of his kitchen counter, opening up his laptop, feeling compelled suddenly to write something. Amy used to sit here, he thinks, when they were still together, and from the kitchen while he cooked breakfast he could watch her as she worked, her bright eyes, the way she would run her hands through her hair in moments of intense concentration. There were still remnants of their life together across this apartment\u2014a lamp that she would purchased, a mug she would given him as a gift, her calendar from the previous year that he would been unwilling to take down and that still had her handwriting on it, reminders to take her birth control pill and turn in their rent checks and call her relatives on their birthdays. But he tries not to look at these objects, even as he thinks about them. Instead, he opens up Word on his laptop, his mind still fixed on the image of the brown guy in the bar, the earnestness of his expression. Ahmed is more drunk than he is been in a long time, and he can feel all the alcohol in his body, pounding through his head, his bloodstream, his heart. But he also feels a sense of clarity he has not felt in a long time, as if he is finally understood what was missing from his early work, as if he is unlocked the secret to something profound, an idea about life that if he loses he will regret for the rest of his years. He takes a swig of beer and let us out a breath. And then he begins writing.",
    "TwoSecondsOfInspiration": "For as long as he could remember, Jalil had always been an Aghazade. \u201cIt is a term of respect,\u201d his father used to say. \u201cIt means you are destined to bring about great change.\u201d Jalil\u2019s father was the one and only Alireza Modaressi, one of the twelve members of the Guardian Council, and the Friday Prayer leader in Qom, Iran\u2019s holiest city. When Jalil was five years old, he would gone downstairs one morning to grab breakfast, and he would seen his father sitting at the kitchen table, dressed in full religious garb, turban and cloak, sipping tea with Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader whom he would seen on TV every day of his life. After that day, Jalil had realized the true power of his father. Growing up, Jalil was never allowed to leave their mansion without permission. If he wanted to go to the park and play, their servant would have to call ahead, and Jalil would always show up to a deserted park that was closed to the public, just so he could play football with other little Aghazades, the sons of other powerful families, as security officers watched them nearby. Jalil was homeschooled and forced to study the Quran day and night. His teacher, another young Aghazade, taught him every subject from math and science to religious studies, but Jalil\u2019s favorite subject was art. He loved the work of Bahman Mohasses, the \u201cPersian Picasso\u201d who painted ghastly Minotaurs and grotesque creatures that haunted Jalil\u2019s dreams. \u201cWhy would he paint those things?\u201d he asked his father once. \u201cBecause artists are heretics!\u201d his father replied. \u201cThey will be damned in hell on Judgement Day.\u201d Religious clerics abhorred art and viewed it as the devil\u2019s distraction, but their hatred only intensified Jalil\u2019s fascination. When he was 13, he told their servant to buy some canvasses and began painting secretly at night, drawing bowls of fruit with vivid colors that filled him with joy. After a year or so, his paintings took a Mohassesian turn and became absurdly grim: three-headed demons shrieking at the sky, men with tortured faces plunging into a lake of fire. Once, he even drew a little boy standing on a chair beneath the word Allah, looping the first letter around his neck like a noose. Jalil was shocked by the anguish that lurked in the depths of his mind. When he was 25, he graduated from seminary school and packed his bags to leave for America. His father wanted him to study International Relations at Georgetown, and he did not know when he would be back, so he stuffed his paintings in a box and tucked them away in the back of his closet, where nobody would find them. At Georgetown, he went to class in full religious garb to represent the Islamic Republic. When other students found out who he was, they were either cordial towards him, out of respect for his culture, or they avoided him entirely. One guy named David was particularly obnoxious. David would show up to class with slicked-back hair and designer button-ups, and he would take frequent bathroom breaks to powder his nose and come back twitching and sniffling, jumping out of his seat to engage in political discussions. \u201cAll I am saying is, you people are fucked,\u201d David told Jalil one day after class. \u201cYou Iranians have the audacity to attack an American tanker in the strait of Hormuz. What the hell were you thinking?\u201d \u201cIt was not us. We did not do it.\u201d \u201cWell then who did?\u201d \u201cI do not know.\u201d \u201cOh c\u2019mon! This is what you guys do every time: deny deny deny!\u201d \u201cI am just being honest with you.\u201d \u201cOh are you?\u201d David chuckled derisively. \u201cYou should be careful about what comes out of your mouth when you talk to me. Do you know who my family is?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Jalil said. \u201cLet me put it this way: my father was in the Situation Room last night with the president and his staff. They are going to send B-52 bombers to your country and blow you to smithereens.\u201d Jalil was concerned. Powerful Americans like David\u2019s father were nationalist hawks, and war with Iran was a real possibility. He wished that he could somehow build kinship with David\u2019s family, so that night he went home and began a new painting. He painted the word Allah with intricately intertwined Persian letters, the first three letters shooting up to give the illusion of stripes, and the tashdid overhead peppered with glitter to resemble fifty sparkling stars. \u201cThis is for you, my friend,\u201d he presented the painting to David before class the next day. \u201cIt is a little gift that I made. It is the Muslim God, but if you turn it sideways, it kind of looks like an American flag. In Islam, we are all considered brothers,\u201d he gave David\u2019s shoulder a tender squeeze. \u201cGive my love to your family, will you?\u201d David turned white as a ghost. He stared wide-eyed at the painting, turning it this way and that way to admire it. \u201cThis is, uh, incredible,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI am glad you like it.\u201d \u201cHow did you even do this?\u201d \u201cI have been painting for a while.\u201d David\u2019s expression softened and he fumbled over his words, trying to say thank you. He squared up and gave Jalil a firm handshake. \u201cYou know, my father paints too. He volunteers at the VA hospital and paints portraits of wounded veterans.\u201d \u201cThat is great,\u201d Jalil said. \u201cI would love to check out his work sometime.\u201d That weekend, David sent Jalil a wonderful email about how much his family loved the painting and how they would hung it up in their living room. Jalil called his father in a cheerful mood to relay what had happened, but his father was not pleased. \u201cYou know I do not care for artistic foolishness,\u201d his father said. \u201cBut dad, I am telling you, the family is really happy. This is a good thing.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of war, and instead of stepping up to be a leader, you are over there drawing pictures!\u201d \u201cI am trying to build connections, dad. And I think I am\u2013\u201d The line clicked and Jalil knew that his father had hung up. He stood stock-still, rubbing his eyes in frustration. He wished that his father could have seen the unexpected jubilation on David\u2019s face, the glint of confidence in his eyes when he would shaken Jalil\u2019s hand. It was obvious that the painting had moved him, but Jalil was so shaken up now that he did not know whether he would made the right decision. The next day, when Jalil was eating lunch in the cafeteria, the evening news blaring from the TV mounted on the wall showed Iran\u2019s president signing some papers, along with four jet-black planes flying menacingly over the ocean. The caption beneath read, \u201cConsensus reached, but B-52 bombers send a clear and unmistakable message.\u201d Jalil grinned. He knew exactly what would happen. The bombers would fly around aimlessly for a while, and some kind of Navy battleship, the USS Something-Or-Other, would be stationed near the Persian Gulf for a few months, just to make it look like something was going on. But there would be no aggression, no military intervention. It was all a show, a bunch of political theatre. Somewhere, his father was probably sitting cross-legged against a cushion, sipping tea in front of the television and smiling at his colleagues, at all of the big-wig clerics who would take credit for having thwarted an American attack. They would joke that America was all pomp and pretense, no longer a global hegemon capable of policing the world, and that the Islamic Republic was an emerging power that sent shivers down Western spines. More than anything, Jalil thought about his painting and his father. His father would probably spend about two seconds wondering whether the painting had truly made a difference, and that two seconds was all Jalil needed to feel inspired, to know that he was not just an Aghazade, but an artist capable of enacting great change. A few weeks later, at the end of the semester, Jalil found a package in front of his apartment door. It was from David. He opened it and saw that it was a painting of a man lying in a hospital bed with an American flag draped over him like a blanket, his head bandaged and his casted leg propped up on a few pillows. He was staring ahead, smirking and holding up two fingers, a sign that Jalil knew meant peace.",
    "MonitorWorld": "She died in the game, and saw him looking at her. That summer, she always spent her lunch outside of the hangar. She ate in her car, or squatted in the shade of the fence, dribbling bottled water into the dirt. There was a game she played on her phone, shooting zombies. Across the parking lot was a pilot school, with a flat roof and a smoky glass door. She never saw a single airplane take off from the tarmac. At lunch, or at five thirty when she was coming out at the end of the day, she would see the man standing on the deck in front of the school. He wore aviator glasses and had a cigarette. She never saw his eyes, but she knew he was looking at her. He had short, bristly black hair, wore a crisp, white shirt with an embroidered insignia and pressed, dark pants, even in the heat. He must have been someone at the school; he must have been a pilot. If she looked him in the face, he did not turn away. Not his mouth, not his body, nothing about his posture ever changed, and particularly not the angle of those impenetrable black lenses always directed at her face. That summer she was twenty-five. Her boss was a guy with a plane and a hangar. She spent from nine a.m. to five thirty p.m. in the hangar, which had a steel-framed ceiling like an enormous tent. It was partitioned so her boss\u2019s plane was separated from them by a makeshift wall, and he rigged up electric fans around the space to alleviate the dead air. She and two others, one twenty-one, one twenty-two, worked on shiny new iMac computers with little labels with their initials: N.R. for her, A.M. for the twenty-one-year-old, K.L. for the twenty-two. They edited web copy. The web copy read as suspiciously scripted, sent in by cheap ghostwriters from non-English-speaking countries. They posted the articles on websites with too many hyphens in the URLs and shared the links on social media websites under fake profiles they made up by the dozens. In the hangar, their screens were visible at all times. There was no privacy. N. hated being the oldest worker there. All around them was arid desert. Beyond the pilot school, there was a diner where some early mornings N. got coffee and listened to the TV. The local news was full of stories of pedophiles and abducted children, bus drivers who were keeping women locked up in their basements for years. Listening to it, you could easily be convinced the world was dark and unnavigable, that danger could swallow you up on any street corner. The waitress was like a character from a Lucia Berlin story. She had brown hair bleached gold by sunlight and bronzed, spotted skin. She knew the girl by sight; she acted motherly toward her. When N. sat down at the cafe, the waitress poured her coffee first, moving protectively through the weather-beaten men wearing the same dark glasses as the aviator who watched her. At twenty-five, N. believed herself pretty enough to be looked at and too old to be mothered. Before that, she had been awkward. In high school, her cropped hair puffed out unevenly and eyeliner ran off her flat, oily eyelids. Her acne had persisted even after her breasts and hips failed to fill out. Her skin was permanently sun-darkened from the laps she would run around the football field. She had grown out her hair, found a skincare routine, and bought different eyeliner, but this last thing, the tan of her skin, was\u2014despite the papaya soap she bought from the Vietnamese market and the kojic-acid soap she ordered from Japan via eBay\u2014the one thing she had not managed to change. The Cave had popped up in her sponsored ads. It had a dark, pixel-art interface that looked decidedly retro, a callback to \u201990s anime predicting what the Internet would look like in the future. The motto was: \u201cfor lovers of the underground.\u201d The chat function used avatar sprites, like something out of MapleStory, and everyone listed some kind of Internet handle instead of their real names, which made it feel a little more like an actual game set in some digital alternate universe and a little less depressing than real life. N. uploaded two pictures into the app. Her username was dDdgh0st. On her profile, under \u201cOccupation,\u201d she would written: \u201cdisembodied digital ghost.\u201d His name was agamemnon_the_king. His chat avatar had purple hair and green eyes. There was one picture, which showed the serious, elegant face of a man with long hair looking directly into the camera, shot in black and white. His age was 31, and his occupation was theatre. Hello, he wrote on the day they matched. What is up, she said. It was evening, she was in the kitchen, and over the island, the canyon sunset was falling through the window. In the refrigerator, her mother had left a wrapped bowl that N. was warming up for a meal. Why is a nice girl like you in a place like this? It was such an old-fashioned line, so casually derogatory; she was intrigued. Looking for a prince, but a king could be better, she wrote. You appreciate me more than my wife does, he said. After a few moments, but not so quickly as to be unconfident, he added, (That was a joke.) Her mother had bought this one-story house in a half-finished development the previous year. There was no father in the picture. Bushes of wild yellow flowers dotted the trails along the neighborhood, and if she got close enough, she could hear the dry hum of bees. There were not enough streetlights and night driving was dangerous. The long distance from the city center would have made it hard for the girl to see her old friends, if she had had old friends, but she had not hung onto her friends anyway. Her mother was an emergency-room physician and was never home during normal hours. Since N. had moved back, mother and daughter passed through the house like two users in an A/B test, with only the bowls of food she left on the counter and the drip coffee N. set to be ready at four p.m. as the tracks of each other\u2019s existence. It had been almost a year since Hillary lost the election, since people had cried walking that night on the streets of New York, and nearly three months since she would left graduate school and found a job off Craigslist editing web copy in an airplane hangar. She was giving half of each paycheck to her student loans. In the bedroom of this home, which was not her childhood home, N. lay on the mattress with the red, flower-patterned duvet she would had as a high schooler, folded her clothes into the white dresser she had once put her first bras into, and drew pictures on a Wacom tablet at the same desk she would studied for her AP Statistics exam. When it got dark, she lowered all the blinds and tried not to feel uneasy at being alone in an empty house on the ground floor. At night the air was genuinely cool, and she would take out her favorite of her graduate school sweaters, then huddle watching anime at her desk and telling herself she was going to shower and sleep, in just ten more minutes, fifteen\u2026 She would downloaded The Cave because she wanted something to happen. A few hours after her last message of lol, just as she was getting ready to shower, agamemnon_the_king wrote, So, what does a nice disembodied digital ghost like you do for fun? Haunt Tumblr, she wrote back, play pranks on the audio tracks of YouTube videos, steal webpages and bring up 404 error codes. He said, What a busy life. Do you ever come out to play in the real world? The King lived in a new apartment complex that was not quite downtown. It took her forty minutes to get there. Racing through the empty intersections and the stoplights blinking red and green, N. thought, Am I really going? Is this really going to happen? She had never done this before: gone to the house of a man she had just met that same day on the Internet. Her car felt like a protective bubble of unreality from the outside world; she felt like she was in a video she could pause at any moment; she was not really inside her body. It was much more plausible to think she was astral projecting and her real body was somewhere else, in bed, sleeping. Her body was only dreaming it was in the car and turning off the exit ramp and stepping on the brake and parallel parking in front of the address she would gotten from agamemnon_the_king. Her body was only dreaming she was texting him, I am outside!, and checking her reflection in the rearview mirror. Everything was a fiction, a fantasy imagined by that body, still in pajamas lying in her bedroom\u2026 agamemnon_the_king walked out of the sliding glass doors. In Real Life, he was short. He had sloped shoulders, a long neck, deep bags under his eyes visible under the streetlight. Then she really was following him inside, up a silent, smooth elevator to a living room where there were stacks of heavy, white books, a deep couch, framed pictures on the wall. He was a little bit uglier than she had thought he would be, and this was comforting and made the scene feel more like play-acting. The man offered her dry wine in a crystal glass, asked her if she was hungry, leaned over the kitchen island, pushed her lips open with the edge of the glass. The wine was dry and left a taste of salt on her tongue as she swallowed. This, the injection of her sense of taste, brought the scene more judderingly into reality for her. She was like Persephone, eating in the underworld. He refilled his own glass, and something about his hooded eyes, how they monitored her, scared and thrilled her. He did not turn on any lights in the bedroom. There was more art on the walls, in large white frames; the shapes were fleshy, grotesque, erotic. The whole time she had been smiling, joking, performing. And still she felt it was not really happening. She was in a cutscene she had to see to the end. This is real/This is not real, she thought, like a coin toss. The man laid her on the bed, peeled off her sweater, ran a finger from her collarbone to her ankle and said, \u201cYou are very lovely.\u201d Liquid pooled into her underwear, which he took off a moment later. When he put his fingers inside her, she thought, apropos of nothing, of the aviator, the dark sunglasses observing her under the omniscient and ravaging sun. The next morning, N. drove to work from the man\u2019s house just after dawn. She had slept for perhaps three, four hours. At the diner, the Lucia Berlin waitress came over with the coffee pot. \u201cSo early today,\u201d the waitress remarked. \u201cHere you go, honey.\u201d At work, she nodded sleepily over the lists of \u201c10 ways to get the most out of your garden fertilizer\u201d and \u201cTry these top 5 anti-virus software for business professionals.\u201d She plucked at her sweater feverishly; should she take it off? She did not want the others to notice she was wearing the same T-shirt. She could still feel the King\u2019s fingers in her. N.\u2019s organs writhed, and she squeezed her thighs together as tight as they would go. \u201cIt will not let me make any more Facebook profiles,\u201d the twenty-one-year-old said suddenly. Their boss stood up. \u201cLet me see?\u201d \u201cI am having the same issue,\u201d the twenty-two-year-old said from his desk. N. looked at the article she was publishing on best-garden-hose-enthusiast.com. After she published it, she was supposed to share it on four different social media platforms under fake names. She opened the Gmail account she would made under the name Linda Hallberg, contributor at best-garden-hose-enthusiast. Your IP address has been blocked due to suspicious activity, Facebook informed her. Her boss went around the other side of the partition and began rummaging around. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d the twenty-one-year-old asked N., but N., who had her earphones in, pretended she did not hear. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d the twenty-one-year-old asked. \u201cI think he is going to scramble our IP address,\u201d the twenty-two-year-old said. \u201cHow?\u201d The twenty-two-year-old shrugged. \u201cI do not know. I just hear that is what people do.\u201d Meanwhile, N. thought, gazing at the Facebook email, no one knew what she had done last night. The sex had been good\u2014so good that, remembering it now, her legs went weak, and she wanted to drive back to the King\u2019s house and repeat everything they had done the previous night, right this instant. She thought of the boys she had slept with before, the awkwardness, the self-consciousness, how the sex had at best been almost enjoyable but never quite. How distant and unreal they felt now. She had come out of the night and left the King\u2019s house alive. Her boss came back and started fiddling with another device. When he bent down, the sweat along his hairline glistened under the artificial light like a lick of slime. It could not be good for them, working in this heat day after day, even with the fans on. N. stared absently at the shiny skin on his forehead. The air felt stifling, the writhing in her stomach intensified\u2014was it the thought of the sex? She fanned herself with one hand; the lights above seemed too bright, and the twenty-two-year-old asked, \u201cEverything all right?\u201d She nodded and scooted her chair directly in front of a fan. She was fine, it was just, she felt, quite, very hot\u2014 And then she was stumbling out to the parking lot and the twenty-two-year-old was following her, asking if she could drive home okay, N. was waving him off, in the car she checked the rearview mirror and saw her skin was pallid, damp, she pulled out of the lot in a reckless swerve, through the rear window she could see the aviator, who had come out to the deck, who was staring at her car under his black sunglasses, standing at the porch of the pilot school. His gaze made her stomach churn more; she stopped the car for a second with an abrupt shuddering of the brakes. She wanted to step out, speak to him, but then she saw his foot move, was he going to walk towards her? Her foot swiveled to the accelerator, she was out on the street, she managed, barely, not to hit the car behind her changing lanes off the freeway, and in her mother\u2019s house in the half-abandoned neighborhood, she was tugging off her sweater and heading to the toilet and lifting the lid and vomiting out an egg-colored bile\u2014but why? She did not feel ill, no, it was good what she felt, tingling all over, from her belly to her toes, yet still\u2014she lifted water into her mouth from the bathroom sink, flushed the toilet, realized she had to pee, pulled down her pants, sat down, and saw the smear of blood on the underwear she had not changed from last night: oh. She had started her period. In graduate school she made an animated short titled CHECK THIS BOX TO VERIFY YOU ARE NOT A ROBOT. It started with a tiny girl with an electrical outlet in her back waking up in an empty bedroom. The girl, the room, everything was sketched out with rough lines and no color. The scene expanded, the girl\u2019s bedroom was actually an enormous control room with a spread of computers and a thick coaxial cable dangling on the floor. The girl plugged herself in and the first monitor turned on. Her avatar popped up on screen, reborn into a new world, and this world was fully realized: it had color, shape, dimension, music, cotton-candy trees. But before long, blocks of gray crept in, there were shadows in strange forms on the floors of the treehouses, the background music turned ominous, the screen flickered, pixelated, squares of gray dotted the sky in binary patterns (cut to: the physical body, comatose below the monitors, twitching), and finally, once the dreamy pink world degraded into a sketchy, draft version just like the real world outside, the avatar found another room with a monitor. There was a new character, a man with a fixed smile, like a mask. His speech scrolled across the screen: Welcome, is not it beautiful here? This place, it is so lovely, I could just stay here forever, sit and watch the world go by without me. This place, it is so lovely, I could just stay here forever. Is not it beautiful here? To sit and watch the world without you. And the second monitor turned on, there was another world in there, full of color that started to bleed out over the edges of the screen, greens and oranges and yellows, pumpkins, a road, the man turned to look, the avatar saw the man had no back, he was all face and nothing behind it, he was completely depthless, a straight line, and the world in the second monitor expanded out and intruded more into the first\u2026 N. was thinking of expanding it into a video game. The girl\u2019s avatar would hop through different monitors and their associated worlds, meeting strange figures (once people?) who talked in long strings of zeroes and ones or Wingdings. Half-heartedly, she was trying to decide how she wanted the story to end: what if there was an option for the avatar to remain in the monitors forever? Maybe it was easier to stay, even in those decaying empty places, than to emerge into the Real World. Maybe all the characters the girl encountered had once been Real People who decided to move into the Monitor Worlds for good. She thought that the girl plugged into the computers probably had some trauma at the back of her life (why else would she avoid her real life so hard?), but N. was not very interested in the \u201cwhy\u201d of things, only the \u201cwhat.\u201d And more and more, she liked staying in the imagination of the Monitor Worlds, creating tableaus of different worlds and color palettes, then ruining them all with a few mouse clicks. The second time she met the King was on a Thursday. He called her over late, eleven p.m., and she once again fell into the comforting sense that they were play-acting. Nothing that happened this far into night could be real, including their meetings, which felt clandestine for no reason. He greeted her with a flourless chocolate loaf cake sprinkled with powdered sugar, and she wondered what he was overcompensating for. On his couch, which was expensive, deep, and very comfortable, he massaged her calves. He had a strong grip. \u201cDo you do sports?\u201d she asked. He said he had a black belt in judo. She felt the thrill of being cared for in a dangerous situation. He had a shelf of DVDs behind the couch. For movies, there were names she did not know, like 10 to Midnight, Death Wish II, Basket Case, Cat People. For music, there were CDs: The Police, Depeche Mode. N. picked up a DVD and looked at the cover: garish and pulpy. \u201cI do not know any of these,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are from the 80s. Classics.\u201d The photos on his wall were of naked bodies arranged in strange poses against a brutalist landscape of a stark black house. The bodies were thin, pale, long-legged, firm. The pictures were not sexy\u2014something about them was very cold. \u201cWhat are these? Porn?\u201d The King laughed. \u201cThey are by a Japanese photographer. He is famous.\u201d \u201cThey are kind of creepy.\u201d Nothing was real, which made her bold. \u201cAre you creepy?\u201d \u201cI like them. Everyone seems like they could turn violent in just a second.\u201d That was what it was, N. thought. The feeling she got from him. Of not knowing whether the next moment would be safe. What was so alluring about being in his company: he rubbed her legs, and she did not know what he would do next. The King slid his hands up her thighs. During the night he started snoring with the deep, throaty rumble of an old man. This punctured the film of unreality and N. wanted to leave. She shifted restlessly around on the bed. One of the small photographs by the Japanese photographer was hung on the wall. In the background was a tiny woman in a ballet pose who seemed about to take off. Swallowing the foreground was a man facing her\u2014his posture, the adamant line of his legs and shoulders, was threatening. On Saturday she was watching TV on the couch when her phone pinged. Still recovering from the scratches you gave me, the King said. The intrusion of the King into her weekend morning was unwelcome. Lol, she typed, though she did not find it very funny. He followed up shortly: What are you up to? I am staying home today, not feeling well Oh no, what is the matter Stomach issues Where do you live? I can bring some soup N. paused. Below her stomach, she felt her intestines knotting together again. Was he being caring, or was this crossing a line? Instinctively, she did not want the King to know where she lived. Even if she did not live with her mother, she would not have wanted him to know. She closed her eyes, her mind swimming with feverish images: the dark highway, the white sugar on the chocolate cake, the airplane hangar, her reflection swimming in the black coffee in the diner\u2026 \u201cDid you eat lunch yet?\u201d her mother\u2019s voice floated into the miasma. Oh. N. opened her eyes and saw her mother there, looking tired. It felt like a long time since she would seen her. \u201cSorry, Mom, I forgot to start the coffee.\u201d She moved to the couch and put a hand on N.\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat is wrong? Are you feeling sick?\u201d Her hand was cool and dry. \u201cMy stomach\u2019s been a little funny.\u201d Her mother brought her hands down and squeezed N.\u2019s feet, hard. \u201cEek!\u201d She squirmed. \u201cMom, it is okay. I already took some ibuprofen.\u201d But her mother\u2019s grip relaxed her. Her mother said, \u201cI will make you some ginger tea.\u201d N. watched her set a small pot on the stove. Her mother was short, thin, and pale, with sensible short hair and a competent, no-nonsense manner. Even watching her bent over the cutting board, N. felt protective of her. \u201cHow is the hospital?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe had a sad case last night. This guy brought a girl in with bruises all over her neck and face. He said she would fainted.\u201d A whispery feeling ran up N.\u2019s skin, like walking through a spiderweb. \u201cDid he hit her?\u201d \u201cShe said she \u2018fell\u2019 because she had \u2018low blood sugar\u2019 and kept asking, \u2018Can my boyfriend stay?\u2019\u201d Her mother sighed. \u201cI asked if I could speak to her alone, but she would not let him leave.\u201d \u201cAt least he brought her in?\u201d \u201cThese abusers do all sorts of things,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d She brought the mug to N. and smoothed her daughter\u2019s hair. When N. brought the cup up to her mouth, the smell of ginger was spicy, pungent, traveling through her nostrils up to her brain where she imagined it lighting a tiny fire. The King started texting her more through the weekdays, even when she did not reply. Think I might need someone to help mount some shelves, haha, have you heard that one? Did you eat lunch yet today? How is work? 3 PM slump I get headaches when it is hot like this It is so dry I have a nosebleed At lunch, N. checked her messages in her car sitting outside the hangar. She tried to identify what she was feeling, and it was repulsion. She did not like that the King was trying to talk to her more now; it was needy and made their encounters less flimsy, less transactional. In the side mirror, she saw the door to the pilot school swing open. The aviator came out and lit a cigarette. It was hot, but there was no trace of sweat on his starched, white shirt. N.\u2019s cellphone pinged again. Are you busy tonight? This would be the last time, N. decided. The King was getting boring. The fear she had so viscerally felt had been replaced by a kind of pity. When she went over, it was raining and only six p.m. In the cool gray light of his living room, the man looked sagged and tired. He brought her a small cup, she brought it to her mouth, took a gulp, almost gagged. She had not been expecting wine. Drinking alcohol without having eaten, N. felt herself growing languid. Turning her eyes onto the man in the early-evening light, she saw the bags under his eyes were puffy, and there were even a few gray hairs at his temple. \u201cWhat have you been doing all day?\u201d she asked. \u201cWatching this old reality show called To Catch a Predator. Have you heard of it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d N. hesitated. \u201cTrue crime?\u201d \u201cYeah. These pedophiles, it is so funny.\u201d The man laughed a short, ugly laugh. Had he always had those jowls? \u201cSome of them say the craziest shit. My favorite one\u2026\u201d Later in bed, after sex, which for the first time felt perfunctory and disappointing, he told her he was writing a play. \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d \u201cCharles Manson.\u201d \u201cThe cult guy?\u201d \u201cHe just died, you know.\u201d \u201cHe was still alive? I do not even know when all that stuff happened.\u201d The man chuckled. \u201cHe was misunderstood. There were a lot of ways in which he was a genius. And charismatic. The guy was a leader! But everyone only remembers the one thing.\u201d N. kept her voice very measured. \u201cBut he was a murderer, right?\u201d \u201cHe did not actually kill anyone himself. It was his followers. The young women.\u201d Suddenly, the King lunged at her stomach and tickled her. \u201cGirls can be scary!\u201d His voice turned high-pitched, incongruously childish. N. wanted to ease away from his circling hand. \u201cSo, what is the new thing about the play?\u201d She tried to change the subject. \u201cLike, how is it different from what actually happened?\u201d \u201cI am thinking of having all the parts played by children. Twelve and under.\u201d \u201cLike, Charles Manson and all the women and everyone are just going to be kids?\u201d \u201cDo not you think it would be cute? All Lord of the Flies. Inherent brutality of humanity and all that.\u201d His voice had turned crueler talking about the children. She did not like the way he sounded. She imagined a young kid on stage, artlessly acting out an orgy. She felt tense, her hands tingled. \u201cI am going home,\u201d she said a moment later. She sounded very natural. \u201cGot To make dinner.\u201d \u201cYou sure?\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou are welcome to sleep here if you want, you know.\u201d \u201cI want to sleep in my own bed.\u201d \u201cWhat is your bed like?\u201d N. turned her head. \u201cThat is a weird question.\u201d \u201cI am curious how you live,\u201d the King said, also sitting up and kissing her on the cheek. \u201cAll right, I will walk you out.\u201d Sitting in her car parked on the curb, she tried the key again and again. \u201cShit.\u201d She took the key out, shoved it back in, turned it again. \u201cIt is not starting.\u201d \u201cI can jump it,\u201d the King said. \u201cDo not worry.\u201d While she waited for him to come back, she wondered if she should call her mother. But nothing has happened, she told herself. Nothing has happened. He had not said anything she could point to as obviously sketchy. She remembered the excitement she would felt the first night meeting him. He had been an unknown, she had felt the rush of getting away with something. There was the way he would looked at her over the food he gave her the first night. His eyes, hooded, intent, obviously monitoring how much she drank. (The casual way he put his hand on the back of her head when she was giving him oral. There was no pushing, but there was the suggestion that if he wanted to, he could.) No one knew she was here. \u201cI have got it,\u201d the King said from behind her. He insisted on following her in his car. \u201cNo, no,\u201d N. said, shaking her head, \u201cit is fine. I am just going home, it is a long drive, do not worry.\u201d Then she bit her tongue, wishing she would said she was expected somewhere else. \u201cI will just go along with you a little bit to make sure there is no problems. What if your car dies again?\u201d \u201cI have triple A,\u201d she lied. \u201cDo not worry,\u201d the King laughed. Under the streetlight, his teeth were not very even. \u201cI am not busy. It is not any trouble.\u201d \u201cYou really do not have to.\u201d N. shrunk away, then, because she was still alone with him on the sidewalk and she was afraid to be rude, she said, giving an excuse: \u201cI live with my parents, so\u2026\u201d He did not seem surprised. \u201cI will not come in,\u201d he promised. \u201cI will not even stop. I will just see you park and make sure everything\u2019s good and drive right off.\u201d He will not take no for an answer, she thought. On the drive back, her arms were locked in so closely to her body she could feel the tightness of her inner elbows. In the rearview mirror she saw the King in a Chevy Tahoe trailing closely behind her. There was heavy traffic. She tried to subtly lose his car, but every time she changed lanes, he reappeared on her left or a car or two to the side, then directly behind her, skimming along confidently. He was wearing black sunglasses, so she could not see his eyes. As though he knew she was looking at him in her mirror, he suddenly grinned. I am never going to see him again, she thought. The world seemed too real now. N. pulled off the freeway early. The stop was near a plaza with a frozen-yogurt chain and yoga franchise. In high school, she would come here after track practice. N. swallowed hard. The Tahoe pressed behind her. She kept driving, trying not to look around too much or go too slowly. She saw a side road with a stone sign and turned. There was a parking garage. Some neat shrubs outside. Without looking at the numbers, she pulled into a spot. In the second between the death of the engine and the shriveling of her seatbelt, a black hole opened inside her lungs. She opened the door. His car was idling behind hers. She prayed whoever belonged in the actual spot did not show up. \u201cWell,\u201d the King said, rolling his window down and looking at her without taking the sunglasses off, \u201ceverything looks good?\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d N. forced herself to smile. \u201cNice little neighborhood.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The King looked around and said, \u201cNo one\u2019s here. Come here a sec.\u201d Unwillingly, N. approached the car window. He pulled her face in by the chin and kissed her on the lips. \u201cSee you next time.\u201d God, his lips are dry, she thought. And too thick. Disgust ran down her esophagus, and she had to stop herself from wiping her mouth. \u201cNext time,\u201d she said easily, and with enormous, invisible effort, lifted the corners of her mouth. She brought her hand up and waved. Surely he was not going to wait to see her unlock a door and go into one of the houses? No, thank God, he was not. The King rolled his window back up and smiled his unpleasant smile at her again. He pressed the gas on his car, looped through the roundabout, and exited the neighborhood. By the time N. got back to her real home, it was dark. She would waited for ten minutes in the parking garage, hiding in the back seat of her car with the lights turned off in case the King, for whatever reason, decided to come back. Then she would driven aimlessly for nearly two hours, going the wrong direction on purpose, before pulling into a gas station, filling up, and at last setting her route to home. From the moment she would peeled from the curb in front of the King\u2019s apartment until now, she had not let herself think or feel too much. Now, her head felt hot, and her heart strangled inside her airless, black-hole torso. She put a hand on the wall to steady herself. Then she turned on every single light in the house and went around pulling down the blinds one by one, avoiding her reflection in the dark pane, avoiding looking through the window to anything beyond, because, because what? In her bedroom, she locked the door. Why are you feeling so scared? There is nothing to be scared of, she told herself. She forced herself to shower and pull on her favorite sweater. She took out her laptop and got into bed. She opened a video game. Her avatar ran around a dirt field shooting little pixie zombies who turned dark green, then purple when they were hit in the brain. The soundtrack was a cheerful piano medley. Gradually, N. felt sleepiness overtake her. She became aware she was hungry; she had not eaten. Her eyes grew heavy on the pillow. I do not have to decide right now, she thought, what I feel. Also, nothing happened, she thought. Maybe I was just being paranoid. She drifted off with the sound on her computer still going and all the lights in her room still on. Perhaps because of that, or because her sweater made her too hot, her dreams were fitful, and all through the night she could not quite tell if she was fully asleep or half-awake. Her stomach hurt. In the bathroom, no vomit came out. When she walked outside, there were noticeably fewer bees than there would been in the middle of summer. Nothing had happened. Nothing had happened. She typed his name into Google. First name + city + theatre. First name + city + name of a university on a hoodie she had seen in his closet. A reverse image search of his profile photo from The Cave. Nothing. His invisibility on the Internet cemented how little she knew about him. An air of doubt had crept into her searching: that she had ever met him or driven to his house, that she had lain on her back in a dark room with pale photographs on the walls\u2026 First name + Charles Manson. First name + Japanese photographer. No hits. She blocked the King\u2019s number. She started avoiding her phone, started turning the radio on when she was driving, started driving faster, started looking out for a black Chevy Tahoe. She started eating her lunch inside the hangar, started leaving work later, started not wanting to be alone, started wanting witnesses. He would not be able to find her; he had not come to her house. They only knew each other\u2019s first names. The fear she felt only in his apartment, only when she had wanted to feel it, was oozing through the cracks in her bedroom walls and made her afraid when driving at night. A week later it was just her and the twenty-two-year-old in the hangar. Their boss had left for lunch. Their mouse clicks echoed into the silence. She could not focus on the horticulturalist-tips-for-single-moms.com article. Coiled claustrophobia threatened to pop every blood vessel in her body. Stealthily, breaking the rule she had set for herself, seeing the twenty-two-year-old immersed in a YouTube video that clearly was not about his assigned topic, best-mixed-martial-arts-gear, she opened a private browser and continued searching for the King online. First name + phone number. His first name had an unusual spelling. \u201cHey,\u201d the twenty-two-year-old said into the dead air of the hangar. \u201cDid you bring lunch? Or do you want to go out and get something?\u201d \u201cMmmm,\u201d she non-answered. And there\u2014in an online directory, the first result on the search engine\u2014were three hits. Something. She clicked on the page. The directory was like an online Yellow Pages. There were full names, addresses, phone numbers, even dates of birth. All this information just available with some swipes on the keyboard. The first two results were people with different spellings of his first name and who lived too far away. The last result was the name of the man who must be the King. The street address was the one she had driven to. He was a real person. The date of birth listed was 1975. She felt her intestines writhing again, like snakes. Pressure ballooned inside her head. N. logged onto Facebook. She was still using the Linda Hallberg fake account. She typed the full name she had found into the search bar. There was one in Arizona, one in Colorado, one in Hong Kong, and there, sixth one on the list: the Facebook profile with the same black-and-white photo from The Cave. In the introduction box, the name of the city they lived in. The name of a liberal-arts college in Vermont, not the one from the hoodie. And a graduation year\u20141997. She counted backward in her head. He must be at least a decade older than he had said. She pushed her chair back. \u201cYes, let us go get lunch,\u201d she said to the twenty-two-year-old. Though it had been a long pause. Though it was too late to respond. The twenty-two-year-old, whose name was Kevin, looked at her, a little surprised. As well he might, she thought, because she had been unsociable for more than two months. He turned out to be gracious. \u201cCool. The diner?\u201d N. drove them the four minutes to lunch in her car. The aviator was standing outside the door of the pilot school smoking. In the diner, the TV news played a story about a woman who had escaped her father\u2019s cult. The Lucia Berlin waitress brought them glasses of ice water. \u201cHi, honey,\u201d she said to N. \u201cThis your coworker?\u201d Kevin was short, baby faced, and very, very normal. He was originally from Texas and had studied business merchandising. He speculated on their boss, their jobs, how much longer it could possibly last. \u201cI mean, it is not like we are making money, but what are you going to do when he runs out of cash?\u201d \u201cOh. I did not think about that.\u201d N. could barely chew on her burrito. Out of habit, she had asked for a black coffee. \u201cYou were in New York, right?\u201d Kevin went on. \u201cBut your family\u2019s here?\u201d \u201cMy mom,\u201d N. said. \u201cAnd I did not want to leave her alone.\u201d \u201cAt least you know people here. My parents moved here in the middle of college.\u201d What people? N. thought. People with real lives? I do not know anyone with a real life. \u201cI do not know a lot of people. I was seeing someone for a bit. I just stopped.\u201d \u201cI am sorry to hear that.\u201d Kevin stopped, then asked, since she was clearly waiting for him to, \u201cAny particular reason, or\u2026?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d N. hesitated, \u201cI started feeling like there were some things that did not add up\u2026 Like some of the things he said\u2026\u201d The thoughts congealed inside her. The King, 31, occupation: theatre. If he was born in 1975, he was forty-two years old. Some of the things he would said about her body, which she would found so flattering and old-fashioned, now she thought he might have said them because he was so much older. How had she let him touch her? What signs had she missed? And what signs had she seen and let go? Had he done this before? The first night, had not he been so confident, so relaxed? How many young women had he seduced? What kind of man\u2026 \u201cI mean, he did not do anything wrong?\u201d she said, half question. \u201cTechnically. Except\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, no.\u201d Kevin leaned forward, shaking his head. He had very pale, fine eyelashes in his baby face. \u201cTrust your intuition. You feel like you cannot trust what he says, like you have been lied to\u2014no matter what, that is not a good way to enter a relationship.\u201d He crooked a smile. \u201cI am sure your mom would want you to be careful.\u201d The overhead lights clarified the tiny bubbles at the edge of the coffee. Suddenly N. wanted to cry. In the rush of everything that had happened since she moved home, her unhappiness, her frustration, the recklessness with which she would met the King, she would forgotten\u2014she was someone is daughter, a beloved daughter, and her mother would be sad if she were hurt. In the car on the way back to the hangar, they were silent. On a loop in her mind, N. recalled the times the King had touched her; she felt disgusted, but she had also let herself enjoy it. She could not lie to herself and say she had not liked it, at least in the beginning. How horrible that she had let herself be touched by him those times, had been so eager, even\u2014 \u201cI have never actually seen a plane take off from here,\u201d Kevin mused, looking out the window where the roof of the pilot school was coming into view. The thought of the aviator being there, watching her from behind dark glasses, infuriated her. She turned into the parking lot with the chain-link fence. In the rearview mirror, she saw the pressed pants, the white shirt, still there. \u201cThat man is always fucking creeping on me.\u201d Kevin turned his neck. \u201cWho? That person standing over there?\u201d N. turned the wheel sharply. \u201cHe is always looking at me when I am out here,\u201d she said, or thought she said, but her organs were writhing again, and that fever-dream miasma\u2014black coffee, sunglasses, TV news, pale bodies, black house, chocolate loaf cake, a cup of wine\u2014was crowding her thoughts. She thought of the girl wandering inside the Monitor Worlds. She wanted the body to wake up. She wanted the body to feel safe. What had she been doing all this time? Her hands tightened on the wheel. CLANG\u2014and then N. was coming to herself, Kevin yelping, \u201cOh my GOD, what are you doing?\u201d and when the car was stopped, she saw she had rolled into the chain-link fence, her engine was still running, and Kevin was unbuckling his seatbelt and opening the door, and the aviator was walking over, taking off his sunglasses, and saying in a light voice she had never heard, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d N. opened her mouth to yell something at the aviator, something like back off or get away from me! But no words came, only a choke of surprise. Coming up to her window\u2014framed by the blue sky, concerned and kindly underneath the black sunglasses that a slender hand held aloft to the side\u2014was the innocent and naked face of a young woman.",
    "HongmenBanquet": "The private banquet room was raucous, adrift with the sound of popping oil and clinking glasses. The waitress noted that most of the diners already bore tomato-red cheeks, their faces flushed from the flow of \u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3you and rice wine. While her colleague busied herself with refilling the glasses\u2014only for them to slosh over and empty as the customers toasted again\u2014she brought in two more dishes and placed them on the lazy Susan, blooming with plates that had been half plucked. The patriarch was treating. Whether or not he would be the one to pay\u2014if he would be beaten by another relative slyly passing a credit card under the table\u2014was another question. With large parties like this, there were always at least three attendees tripping over themselves in their efforts to foot the bill. In the few months of her waitressing career, she had witnessed families sitting at cleared tables for hours arguing over the check, elbows knocking into faces in their efforts to prove filial piety. The patriarch had ordered half the menu and servers continued to stream into the room, their arms warm from the undersides of porcelain plates. Gu\u00f2 b\u01ceo r\u00f2you: square slices of pork, garnished with garlic and drizzled in Sh\u00e0ox\u012bng cooking wine. Fish heads fried in oil, their filmy eyes gazing blankly at the mouths that would bury them. Long, doughy noodles for longevity, soaked in chili oil and red vinegar, slurped down burnt throats. \u201cThis is a homecoming,\u201d he would announced to the girl who took the order, \u201cdo not let our mouths or cups go empty.\u201d The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the feast was a thirteen-pound roast suckling pig. Its legs were splayed out comically on the platter as if the creature had been drawn and quartered. The resemblance its face once had to a pig's had been burned away\u2014its eyes charred slits, its snout shriveled from heat. They decorated the corpse with orange slices of persimmons and clementines, pieces of pineapple, a bed of napa cabbage. Though not heavy, the platter was large and unwieldy and had to be carried by two waitresses. They nearly spilled the pig into a girl's lap as they lifted the platter over her head and onto the table. The waitress observed that this girl, sitting closest to the door, was an ABC. She would passed the back of her head, that sheet of dyed blonde hair, enough times to know. The few ABC's she encountered seemed indignant to be exposed as outsiders, thinking they could sink into Chinese society without so much as a ripple. Picking an American out of the crowd was easy, even if they wore a Chinese face. The tells were there: her Mandarin was clunky and devoid of a regional accent. She wore a thin, strappy dress that revealed tanned shoulders. The hair. Most damning was that she had choked on her first glass of \u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3you, resulting in a continuous cough soothed only by an entire bowl of rice. Chopsticks frantic as she shoveled the grains into her mouth, looking to scrape the burning from her tongue. The waitress silently brought a second bowl of white rice, placing it at her side. With large, watery eyes set in a sickly face, she turned to her and said in English, \u201cThank you,\u201d forgetting where she was. Which was how the waitress knew the \u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3you was working. May's extended family was Northern, born and bred in J\u00edl\u00edn since it was called Manchuria, which meant that the act of knocking back \u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3you was instinctual: an inherited muscle memory. In the brutal winters, chill and slant snow cutting down to the bone, warmth came from a glass. The pooling of b\u00e1i ji\u01d4 in the stomach lent heat when heat was too expensive or firewood too dry. In the summers, swamp-like and sticky, they chased away their discomfort with drink. Ankles swollen from clusters of mosquito bites, heat stroke, frostbite\u2014all maladies that could be cured by a generous pour. The Chinese phrase for cheers is g\u0101n b\u0113i: to dry your cup. May was learning that the Li family took this very seriously, and several aunts and uncles had been checking her shot glass, inspecting for wayward drops. Refusing her protestations, the relatives plied her with shot after shot, toasting to her arrival. After three shots, she had learned her lesson. If she came up for air before the bottom was bone dry, she would be forced to take another full drink. Once she downed the proffered drinks, she made sure the underside was bone dry so that she could see her reflection: warped face, now green with nausea, stretched eyes converging in a tiny, pointed chin. May could no longer feel her mouth, sensation swallowed up by the acridness of the alcohol. A half-blind Baidu search beneath the table revealed that \u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3you, a b\u00e1i ji\u01d4 distilled from sorghum, was 100-proof. Still, the heat and bitterness were foreign, different from the fraternity-served Everclear that she had once tried at university. Warmer, too, than the overpowering smell of bleach. Her grandfather\u2014seventy, with the carcasses of six shot glasses spread before him\u2014seemed unaffected. Rosacea blistered his cheeks in a permanent flush. She could never tell if he was drunk or sober. May remembered that in high school, her English class had read The Canterbury Tales. Her teacher had taught them that the Wife of Bath's red complexion was a marker for her promiscuity, her lust. Too much blood, she had explained, meant having a sanguine temperament among the four humors. In the case of May's l\u01ceo ye, the medieval theory proved true. May's mother was one of seven children. Two were legitimate siblings, but the rest were bastards, raised in shadows by single mothers. Some of these half-siblings had found their way back to l\u01ceo ye in the last decade, and this exposed secret was why her grandfather and May's mother were estranged. Why May's mother had protested against May's planned graduation trip to her homeland: a fight so intense that May had blacked out. She circled the memory of its resolution like tub water around the drain, the moment a strange lacuna that was just outside of May's grasp\u2014 May was poured another shot and forced to down it amidst cheers of g\u0101n b\u0113i! The round table was crammed to bursting with Lis from different family lines reaching over one another to spin the lazy Susan and serve themselves their preferred dishes. Some of them only shared an ancestor three generations back. May was unable to differentiate between these distant cousins and her maternal uncles and aunts, her mother's half-siblings. May referred to all the relatives as Sh\u016bshu or \u0100y\u00ed. Men were Sh\u016bshu. Women were \u0100y\u00ed. L\u00e1i, l\u00e1i, l\u00e1i, an \u0100yi said, using her chopsticks to gesture toward May's empty plate. May dutifully handed it to her, and the \u0100yi began to pile the plate high with pinches of dishes: twice-cooked pork, chicken stewed with mushrooms, Peking duck wrapped in a pancake, pork and cabbage wontons. To top it off, a rough-cut slab of the roast pig riddled with fat deposits. H\u00e0o le, h\u00e0o le, May laughed. Enough, enough. \u0100i y\u0101, the aunt exclaimed, t\u00e0i sh\u00f2you le. Too skinny. Other relatives nodded in agreement. May laughed again, the sound half-strangled. She knew that if she were not as thin as she was, they would chide her, prodding her with an \u0100i y\u0101! X\u016b y\u00e0o ji\u01cen f\u00e9i! You must lose weight! Her mother had said this when May was eleven and baby fat pillowed over her bones. Her round cheeks culminating in a round body that spoke of preadolescence. Under her mother's roof, she was fed scraps all through high school: the peeled whites of eggs, the skins of tomatoes, the guts of a nearly hollowed sweet potato. Eventually, she found comfort in the way her fingers slotted between her ribs. Weaned on hunger, she craved its familiarity\u2014the gnawing acidity shoring up along the sides of her stomach a daily lullaby. Skinny just like Fang, a Sh\u016bshu said. Another \u0100yi clucked her tongue, You could never put meat on Fang. She was born in the winter. January, the coldest month. A slippery wonton kept wriggling out of May's chopsticks like an earthworm burrowing back into the ground after being brought out by the rain. She left it wilting at the bottom of her full bowl. What does being born in the winter have to do with it? May asked. M\u011bi gu\u00f3 m\u00e8i mei\u2014American little sister\u2014in J\u00edl\u00edn when your mother was born, you could not even fill a baby's belly in the winter, an uncle answered. Yes, you should feel lucky to have so much food in front of you, an older relative lectured. The older generation smiled at her, nodded encouragingly to her plate\u2014a signal for her to eat. They chewed with their mouths open, and in their smiles, they showed May glints of digestion through the slats of their yellow teeth. Not wanting to appear thankless, May picked at a piece of duck, forcing a close-lipped smile as she chewed. Her mouth punctured the crisp, papery skin, sunk into a cushion of fat. She held back a gag as she swallowed its softness. Here, have some more fish, a Sh\u016bshu offered, plopping a full fish head into her rice bowl. Its unblinking eyes surveyed her as she politely buried its taxidermic gaze under the starch of rice. Used to be the only place you could get seafood up here was through D\u00e0li\u00e1n, the Sh\u016bshu said, but now we can eat seafood just like the south. He picked up a shrimp, its pink, fetal curve wrapped around a chopstick, and ate it in one bite\u2014she will, eyes, and all. Another \u0100yi sighed, Do you remember how we used to prepare for the winter? And now, so much food in J\u00edl\u00edn you could gorge yourself to death on it. She was around May's mother's age, but her hair was bone white, roots and all. The ceiling light that bounced off its whiteness made May's pupils constrict. So many blisters from digging, a Sh\u016bshu groaned. We used to have to bury our vegetables, the white-haired \u0100yi explained to May as she leaned over to pour her more rice wine. Each fall, a truck would come to us from the countryside, carrying thousands of j\u012bn of napa cabbages, winter radishes, potatoes. If you had the money, you could buy your vegetables early, dig out your dirt cellar before the ground got too hard. We never had the money, a Sh\u016bshu said with a full mouth, his chortle becoming a choke. Someone slapped his back hard. We would get the thin harvest and have to spend a day carving out three meters from half-frozen dirt. And if we could not dig deep enough, we would have to pickle the rest. No apples for us, an uncle said, shaking his head. Wealthier families could get hundreds of j\u012bns of apples for the winter, but we were too poor to afford sweet things. Our tongues were made for dirt and bark and starvation. Your mother used to refuse to dig the cellar. Or dig up the snow when Ma needed vegetables from the cellar. Your mother was afraid the manual labor would harden her hands, leave her cheeks chapped and peeling from windburn. Beauty was more important to her, and it was a currency she was rich in. Well, see now how it paid off: she is in America and we are here. Her vanity got her further than our labor. \u0100i y\u0101, an older \u0100yi cut in, shaking her head. How can you say such shallow things about a mother to her daughter? May and her mother's shallowness were intimate friends. May wanted to say she did not mind, but the \u0100yi barreled on. M\u00e8i mei, she began, do not pay attention to their drunken bitterness. They have become too modern, too Western. Do not forget that filial piety to your mother is the most important virtue. In F\u00fazh\u014dyou where my husband is from, they have an entire festival to celebrate mothers: Aojiu Festival. This \u0100yi also had white hair, cut short and permed so that the curls clung close to her head. She wore two cardigans buttoned over one another and seemed to be in her sixties. Ma, the \u0100yi sitting next to May groaned, Aojiu Festival is not only about filial piety. And how would you know? May blinked the film from her eyes, observing the woman next to her. Underneath the neatly styled white hair was a young face, no more than thirty-five. The skin around her eyes was unlined, free from crow's feet. The young aunt, ignoring her mother, smiled kindly at May. Aojiu Festival celebrates the dead, like today's Hungry Ghost Festival. We Northerners celebrate by burning Hell Bank Notes and paper houses for our dead. Then we ply our family's ghosts with different foods: duck, twice-cooked pork, a whole chicken, fried fish, four kinds of fruits. But in Fuzhou, they nourish their dead with Aojiu porridge. She raised a challenging gaze to her mother. Did you dye your hair, May blurted out. It was a drunk thought that became a drunk digression. She had been studying the aunt closely. The color mirrored her mother's white to the hue, but she was too young to have started graying. The \u0100yi's hand flew to her hair, touching the fine strands. She seemed surprised at the question, mouth opening and closing silently like a fish. Around them, conversations petered out. They turned their attention to the \u0100yi's answer, the silence that ensued unnatural. May looked around, confused by how the texture of the room had changed. The aunt's white head bowed sheepishly under the scrutiny, I do not know if I am the right person to tell m\u00e8i mei this story. If she should hear it all. Aunts and uncles exchanged looks with one another\u2014their pupils flickering to each side\u2014unsure how to answer. At last, l\u01ceo ye said quietly, M\u00e8i mei should know what the Japanese did to our family. So it was law, and the aunt began to tell the story. Five generations before you, May, our family lived in the northernmost part of J\u00edl\u00edn, near the village of H\u01ceil\u00edn. Your l\u01ceo ye's grandmother, your great-grandmother, had three sons before l\u01ceo ye's father. They were good sons. All that poverty and hunger, and it just made them kind. It was the winter of 1933. They had run out of food, so their mother took them into the neighboring woods. They scavenged for willow buds, which is what the geese ate in the winter. While she was sifting her hands through the snow for whatever life she could eat, she heard the indent of feet nearby. When she looked up, she saw her younger brother, whom her eldest son had taken after: the unruly black hair, the square jaw, the red lips that she had once teased him for. But he had enlisted in the Anti-Japanese volunteer army and died a few months ago. This brother wore a straw hat and a thin, white kimono, but he had the same mannerisms. He tugged at the fingers of his other hand impatiently, smoothed his hair anxiously. So she could not help but approach him when he extended a hand, even though an innate part of her knew he was a gu\u01d0\u2014a ghost. This was her first mistake. He was not gu\u01d0, but oni\u2014a Japanese demon brought to the mainland by the Kwantung Army. He lived with the doctors and officers in H\u01ceil\u00edn, where they had established Unit 643, a sister branch to 731 in P\u00edngf\u00e1ng. The oni did the doctors' bidding, because they would struck a deal. They fed him the bodies of their failed experiments to keep their war crimes hidden. What did the oni care if his meat had been infected with anthrax? For all the centuries he had been alive, he had never seen so many bodies, laid out for him like a feast. The Japanese had no use for the corpses after they had died. They called the Chinese maruta\u2014lumber\u2014and they said they were just felling trees. Clearing the forest. And the oni\u2014well, he had gotten used to gluttony, so he stayed in H\u01ceil\u00edn. The doctors and officers alike had asked him to bring back a woman, preferably of child-bearing age, but they would take a girl too. He had seen the woman in the forest, and though she had little meat on her bones, she had red in her cheeks and long, dark hair, and he knew the men would be pleased. He saw that she wore a mourning band on her left sleeve, so he shifted into her loss. At first, she came willingly. But. But she knew her brother's hand from the years of leading him around, and this was not his hand. She began to thrash and scream, yelling for her sons to run, but the oni was strong and he dragged her through the snow, leaving a trench dug by her body in their wake. Her eldest son saw his mother being pulled to H\u01ceil\u00edn, and he hid his younger brothers in a hollow tree, deep in its roots, so that the underground would keep them warm. He ignored her warnings and chased after her. When the Japanese men saw the mother, they were pleased, but they did not take her like they had so many other women. (Always in cells, always at gunpoint.) Instead, they had devised a new experiment. A hybrid child. They made the oni shift into its true form: eight feet tall, skin as blue as frostbite, a jaw as wide as her head. Yawning open, it revealed a set of sharp canines. Two horns spun out of its head. And when she wanted to die from this sight, they had it consume her, rutting its hips into her, its three-fingered hands leaving bruises the color of its skin on the bones of her pelvis. The mother lost consciousness. She believed she would died, and her spent body mimicked death so well that the Japanese threw her out in the snow\u2014a maruta not even worth kindling now. Just another failed experiment. The son had been trailing the mother and the oni, their deep tracks easy to follow. He saw it take her into the facility, and he lingered in the surrounding woods, waiting for dark. But the oni was not the only y\u014dkai at Hailin. They had brought over a yuki-onna for the doctors' hypothermia experiments. Like the oni, they had lured her in by the sheer number of bodies: a line of men in the snow that she could freeze to death, whose souls she could slurp up through their blued lips. Sometimes the doctor had her leave them alive, freezing a limb until a finger or toe fell off. The doctor liked watching the skin of the maruta turn black under the yuki-onna's breath, hit the frozen limbs with his cane until the sound was the same as a thwack against wood. That day, there were no frostbite experiments, so the yuki-onna drifted in the cold, where she was comfortable. The son did not see her, because she had white skin and wore a white kimono, blending in with the winter landscape. She saw him, and because she was hungry, she did not bother freezing him before sucking at his life. Her teeth notched into his soul, tugging, but when she faced him, she saw that he was just a boy, not a man, an innocent, and her mouth opened. In that small bite, she had already leeched out the color from his hair, leaving it as white as her skin. The boy tore himself away from the yuki-onna, and his soul dropped back into his body. When he looked up, she was gone, icicles in the place she had been floating. Now every Li descended from this eldest son is born with white hair, that missing heirloom still pickled in a demon's belly. The son saw his mother, stripped of her clothes, thrown in the snow. When it was dark, he carried her to the tree with his brothers and waited out the night before going home. Her eyes were gaping open, jellied, but there was no familiarity there. She had let the white-haired boy tug her away, though she did not know who he was. She remained in this chrysalis\u2014her sons fed her broth, closed her open eyes at dusk\u2014until she reached the third trimester. At which time, she woke. In Chinese numerology, the number four, s\u00ec, is unlucky, because it sounds like the character for death, s\u01d0. This fourth son, growing in her belly, was unlucky for other reasons. For the last two months before she would give birth, she tried to kill him in the womb. She gathered thuja, safflower, silver wormwood, and crushed them into her tea, which she drank daily. But he would not die. If he would not die, then maybe he would survive the North after all. When he was born, she loved him unwillingly. She saw that he was still half-human: half her. His skin was the color of moss\u2014blue and yellow mixed\u2014as if his whole body was covered by a Mongolian mark. The two bumps on his hairline the only other sign that something was amiss. This, you see, was your l\u01ceo ye's father. Oh dear, we have upset you. Have not we, May? You do look a little green. The \u0100yi fretted, her hands flitting nervously in her lap. May's throat had gone dry. She had heard this story before. Recently. When? May felt everyone is eyes turned toward her, searing onto her skin, their bloodshot pupils wet with pity. Was she crying? May reached a hand to wipe the corners of her eyes, but when she felt her cheek, it was oozing\u2014a half-state between liquid and solid. Her fingers came away with elastic, red cheek meat. She held up a shot glass, looked at her reflection. Her skin was melting off, sloughing down her bones in ruddy drips. She blinked. She looked up at her family. The pity in their faces intensified. What is happening? May asked, panic in her voice, though some innate part of her knew. It is almost time for you to go, l\u01ceo ye said. We hope you had a good meal. We did not want to tell you, a Sh\u016bshu said. You seemed so content, an \u0100yi said. But you asked. You should not have asked. Not now and not then. When? May asked. The flesh of her eyelids started running in rivulets until there were no eyelids, only the bulge of her naked eyes in their sockets. May, we know you remember. Think back, how did you get here? You cannot remember, can you? You cannot remember packing or sitting on the plane. It was spring break. You were home, and you asked Fang. You asked her why she did not want you to visit us. She told you we were no good, that a whole ocean was not wide enough to get away from us. Us and our bad blood. Us and our monstrosity. You asked her to explain, and she did. But May, you could not live another moment with this inheritance. Fang called home when she found your body. We had not heard from her in years. She remembers the smell. Burnt beyond recognition, the soft parts corroded: the eyes, the nose, the mouth. Fat liquefying into pearlescent soap bubbles, shimmering with color, until the bone and garish red muscle were exposed under the fluorescent lights: shiny and open. Drowned in a bathtub of bleach to burn off the otherness, the oni-ness. No, May wanted to protest, that is not right. But her tongue was burning, breaking down in her mouth, and she was remembering. The aftermath. The realization that she could feel no comfort with her existence. Washing her hands with the bottle of bleach under the bathroom sink until they blistered. Scrubbing away at the revulsion for herself that ran bone-deep, blood-deep, and her swollen, pustuled hands pouring the bleach into the tub, gripping the sides as she lowered herself in. How she sighed at the cleanliness she felt in the flaying pain before\u2014 We will see you again next Hungry Ghost Festival.",
    "LoveYouToPieces": "I found her in pieces discarded on the sidewalk: an old apothecary cabinet with blackened silver knobs, each bin a lost secret, a pile of shattered drawers that had once been used to put away delicate lingerie, a mannequin's head, chest-less arms. I made her whole again, cleaned every surface, and every nook with the most care one could expect from a carpenter like myself. Removed lint, stains, buffed, repainted, re-nailed, and layered her with the creamiest varnish, her body reconstructed with a hundred drawers ready to put our memories together. I gave her the mannequin's head, covered it with ebony flying hair, drew fleshy pink lips, and affixed her freshly waxed arms. I lathered her with my love, and she trembled alive. She smelled cedar and her laughter crisp like a Spring breeze. I called her Annie, and she loved me back with all her might. She was curious of our human-made technology and was particularly fascinated with the smartphone. She wanted one grafted on her left palm and I obliged\u2014we even named it pholm\u2014so she could constantly be checking her texts and tapping back love notes to me. We were pholm-tethered while I was away from her, shaping chairs and stools from rugged wood at the furniture company. Besides binging on NetFilm, I was her sole occupation. She fretted when my replies took longer than a minute to appear on her screen. There were other issues between us, like all couples do. When we hugged, her drawer knobs poked my chest, the sharp corner of her shoulders made a dent on my chin when I fell asleep on her, we could not spoon each other without pinching my calf on her hinges or bumping my big toe against one of her panels. I almost stepped on the screen of her pholm once while messing around. My clumsiness infuriated her. Her pholm was like her lifeline, a vein bringing oxygen to her heart. She thrived on efficiency, a press on her pholm would bring Chinese take-out when I was too tired to cook from a long workday, bathroom tissues she had forgotten to purchase, or a YouRide if we needed to get to the movies, everything had to be at the tip of her thumb. She lapped up all the romantic movies, like That Christmas I Met You and whispered dialogs she would heard to my ear as I fell asleep on the couch. She treasured my words and stored them in her tiny drawers of her cabinet body, kept them wrapped in tissues, and would pull them out to hear them again like favorited songs. She had a special drawer for I love you when I said it to her the first time. She would take it out to remind me I have not said the phrase for a while. She loved asking questions like, what would I do if I could go back to the past, who I had lunch with, when did I know I loved her. She catalogued and compartmentalized each sentence into her carefully organized drawers. Over time, she began opening and pulling out every word I had shared with her. What would I be doing if we had not met? I said I would not know, maybe I would be with someone else. That earned me an entire day of silent treatment. That time I mentioned I danced with my colleague Evie at the company Christmas party. That was too intimate. That time I mentioned an ex-girlfriend. That was disrespectful. That time I told her I needed some space. That was insulting. That time I refused to be Super Glued to her hip. That was degrading. I had become her experiment, I did not pass her secret exam, and every answer I gave turned into red flags in her book. I told her, it was not working anymore, she and I. We fought. Drawers banging, door slamming. She cried, I cried. She sloshed back all the tears I she would into her chest. Threw me and my tools out on the street. Said it was lame for a man to cry.",
    "MissFreckle": "There is a freckle who lives on my nipple, on the southwest corner of my right breast. I would give you the exact longitude and latitude, but only if you promise to kiss her right, the way that makes her sigh not yell, blow on her gently like you would when wishing on a fallen eyelash, lick her like a crumb of your most favorite dessert that you cannot bear to let go to waste. Miss Freckle has traveled the world. She has dangled off a mountain edge in Cuzco, eaten ant eggs in Mexico City, fought with night market vendors in Penang, nestled comfortably among the redwoods in Big Sur. She has felt the cool wash of waterfalls, the dry heat of deserts, the sticky sweat of tropical beaches, the mosquito bites of jungles. She has felt the back of hands, rough and wanting, soft and waiting. She has tasted breath and saliva, the delicate amylase both sweet and sour, warm first when the lips land, then cool when the mouth lifts. She is direct, determined, looks you in the eye and tells you what she wants and how she wants it. In certain circles she is a celebrity, whispered about in the most hushed of tones, the perfect size and shape. The thing is \u2014 some men do not listen to Miss Freckle. I have heard her mutter, then murmur, then shout, then scream, all the things she wants, faster, slower, more, less, not today, please not today, tomorrow, I have a headache, I hate you, go away, no no no, and still, the angry hands arrive, persistent, sweating, entitled, determined to take what they want, yet forgetting to give what was asked. The women inflict their violence in different ways \u2014 in snide, sideways looks that say she was asking for it, in hushed voices that whisper, well he has always been nice to me, in spiteful glances that hiss you know it is lopsided right? Mothers and aunts and sister urge Miss Freckle to limit access, create doors, gates, and bouncers with bras, shirts, and sweaters. Everyone reminds Miss Freckle that only men get to wear their desire openly; that for women to display want is gluttony, and no one wants to be around that kind of shame. All of it makes Miss Freckle rage, and this rage makes her bulge, the little brown fleck becoming a spot, and then mole, and then a wart filled with pus, swollen, imbalanced, in pain. I take Miss Freckle to the doctor who prods and pokes her; she holds her breath, taut and hurting, tears leaking out of her corners. The doctor tells me she has to go; she has become a growth, benign yes, but a menace; he says he will lance her off, says there will be no pain, no scar, and I will not even remember she was there to begin with. Miss Freckle shakes so hard I feel her quivers pass through my ribs. \u201cMake it stop,\u201d she pleads, \u201cDo not let them take me away.\u201d I feel so bad for her, so furious at everyone who disregards her desires, her wants, her agency. I whisper that I will care for her, that no one will get to lance her, or bite her, or hurt her or shame her, disappear her, without her permission. I take her home and soothe her, make a warm compress and press her bulging sides gently, rub cool ointment on her. At first, I feel her throb against the nipple distrustfully. Then I feel her relax. The swelling subsides, her edges smoothen, her contours go back to the symmetrical brown roundness I used to know. After a week indoors, just the two of us, I take her outside. The sun peeks through the clouds as though to spotlight our re-emergence, reminding us of the joy of our togetherness away from prying eyes and pressing hands. A mynah bird whistles, then the leaves of the angsana trees whistle too as the breeze sneaks by. Miss Freckle arches in my nipple, peeps through my shirt, turns her brown face towards the sun, and sighs a long, happy sigh.",
    "SmokeAndFish": "Ong Hai is the one who teaches me about the smoke. It had been around before I was born, rising up and up, curling over heads, drifting past trees and waste and punishment. Ong Hai once told me that every time it rained, birds would shelter under the eaves of his sheet metal roof and do nothing but cough, cough, cough. But he said that was years ago and their throats were all scraped songless, and now whenever a storm hunched over them, they would fly from tree to tree with their mouths splayed open, netting the rain like fish, feasting on what the sky owed them, the thunder. I have never heard thunder, but a part of me wonders if it is like live meat falling out of the sky in a cardinal rain: a rain that is been souring the water, settling acrid like a curse on the tongue. At first everyone blamed the smoke on the war, then the steel plant, and, finally, the water. But Ong Hai says it is not water but grief at the bottom of the sea. He explains that there was a banyan on the moon, a many-limbed tree with shadows long enough to floss out the stars, and leaves that could heal the body tofu-blank, that extracted pain like a tooth. After a thousand years of foreign invasion the Jade Emperor summoned the banyan down, shaped it into a container, and flung it into the sea to hold grief deep enough to swallow anything: tanks, doorknobs, rice bowls, flames, cities, whole cows, the names that stoned in our throats, bridged us at our backs. I imagine the container grained and glittering, swelling with light\u2014light like salt in the water, light like ghost teeth. I have never found it but Ong Hai did. He told me that as a boy, he contracted dysentery on a French military ship and found himself at the bottom of the South China Sea. He was the first kid on the ship to spot the container. Thinking it was stuffed with rice the Japanese stole, he tried to smash it open and come home a hero, and by the time he made a dent, he had no skin left. He was that kind of boy, all bones, homeless. He is still alive, of course. When the container did not open he sat on the seafloor and cried and cried until he became fluent in salt, the ocean. That is when it opened, Ong Hai said\u2013opened up wide as rivers, took him in, shrouded him entirely like the dead. And when he came back up, he was older and had an accent and knew loss so well he floated through the world as if his body was made of nothing. Apparently he would been at the seafloor for almost five generations until grief was discovered by a group of divers in the mid-2010s. They were searching for the source of cyanide in the ocean, which had led to the death of tons of fish, clams, shrimp, and cuttle in over four coastal provinces, as well as four hospitalizations caused by seafood poisoning. The day Ong Hai re-emerged, there were so many dead fish floating on the water that you could walk like Jesus across the surface of the sea, all the way to China, or that is what he claims. The oldest diver was the first to spot the container and was also the one charged with breaking it. But according to Ong Hai, the container had already been shrinking. That is how fish get to heaven, he told me one morning. It is because grief\u2019s been escaping. Fixing wings on them. He pointed the golden sprig of his finger up into the sun and light streamed into it like rain. I tilted my head up and squinted as if I could see it: being outfitted with flight, bones inhaling more air, more oxygen. That evening in early spring, the container crumbled in the diver\u2019s hands and all remaining captive grief had broken free. The final grief to escape is believed to have originated from the ghosts of the dead themselves. It rushed at the diver as if it had been waiting, and there were rumors after that when soldiers in pond-green uniforms came to arrest the diver the next morning, they found him on his back, in bed, spirits billowing out his mouth like incense, the air carrying names on its tongue. Local officials have been blaming a Taiwanese plastic company for causing the smoke, but Ong Hai thinks it is them. They are rounding up the dead fish, he said, converting them to coal. He says that is why you do not see bodies flaking the sand anymore, why the wind smells like scorched beach, like cartilage soaked in sodium. Fish are being burned until another sky scrolls white over us, making another light, the clouds knitting together by the lineage of their bones. I ask Ong Hai what happens to burned fish if all the grief is gone, and he laughs at me. No, he says, just look at the sky. It is still bringing them up, bringing them to their next lives. If you were dead you would see it. You would see it everywhere."
